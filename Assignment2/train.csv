"I had to put in a drain well/french drain, and the ground about 6 inches down was all mud and clay. ÿ

I was ass over end in this hole, scooping clay mud and was joined by probably ten of these mud daubers for a couple hours.

They never bothered me at all. ÿIn their own little way, they were kinda helping out, I suppose.

They?d build nests in the garage where I workout, and aside from almost smacking into each other, they never bothered me. ÿThey?d just go back and forth, building their mud tubes and filling them with paralyzed spiders.

I think they helped with garden pests, and we had so many spiders, I didn?t mind them culling that herd either. ÿ",Canberra

"Canberra has a bigger issue with strata. Rates +Land Tax + Body Corp is way too high against rental income, making effectively 5% ROI on average and that?s before maintenance costs, taxes and turns a massive blind eye to the fact that Apartment prices mostly depreciate in value, not appreciate like most of the other major cities.

Cons


*You're right on horse park drive so will be in earshot of hooning.

"The solution is either cutting services and increasing direct taxes, or annexing the states who have revenue streams from mining royalties. Even then, all the states and jurisdictions still have dreadful financial positions except for WA which is swimming in money.

It will be interesting to see the impact from the federal election too.

"I can't comment on current educational experiences as my kids are now adults, but ...

I kept an excellent library at home. Firmly stocked with **genuinely** interesting books, not just pretentious intellectual wank.

Solid reading, lots of classics, good selection of the ancients too. A few good graphic selections such as Asterix and Tin Tin .... Those were included to show that good stories can be conveyed in such form.


The kids also received a monster dictionary, a thesaurus and a etymology tome when they were young. Not silly little books, but huge great things they thought were magic books...

These were for reference. They still have them today.

I did this as the schools must teach the curriculum. It isn't bad, but as with all things provided en masse it can be generic.

"So here is the : [ANU TOWNHALL](https://vimeo.com/1038444743/5f7cfb9533?share=copy) : where the ANU tried to explain the numbers to the staff. You may note the half hour Q&A has been the last time they have taken questions on this from staff (December 12).

The graph at 31:17 (to me, a not economist) seems to say that their federal grants for education, and combined tuition fees, are about on par with the expenses forecast for ?recurring? costs. Which were also on par with their budget. Recurring costs includes staffing in these figures, so does that not mean they are essentially? paid for? Especially if you include those other costs (parking, housing etc) as being able to contribute to both recurring expenses (and therefore revenue) and some of the depreciation considering the newest building are all primarily residences?

The dip in intl tuition can be expected. They said they prepared, but clearly for not as much. Months earlier, the ANU had even said that it was because of the possibility of student caps. Which are no longer going ahead, and the figure hasn?t changed ?

So like? the budget issue isn?t really about staffing?? But about the research costs? 
Why are we cutting 650 jobs? 
Why did it blow out that much? 
Where did a $250mil figure come from as a reduction for annual costs? 
Why has no one seen any consultation or assessment that pointed to **that number** as a target for VC Genevieve Bell?

"As an ANU student I understand that fuddy duddy academics probably aren?t the best economic managers but at the very least they aren?t raking it in to the point where I?d question their leadership priorities. 

I think an academic institution stands to gain little when led by a cush job chancellor and a corpo vice chancellor. Bell isn?t going to work hard to find creative solutions, she will (as we have seen) utilise the shareholder placation technique of slash & burn. 

I?m yet to see Bell or Bishop on the ground either, but I?ve run into and had good conversations with Schmidt. I think Schmidt was good because he understood that a university runs on its professional expertise and reputation, neither of which take less than decades to heal after being burnt. Conversely, Bell appears to see the wage bill as just a bill to be reduced. This leadership style does not suit Australian universities and is not conducive to long term growth.",Canberra
"It?s definitely an important area for policy development. Education of strata managers, committee members and owners is essential.

"Traveling from Sydney is most convenient. The bus is relatively cheap, reliable, clean, safe and runs hourly. It takes around 3-3 1/2 hours on the bus.

If you have to travel from Brisbane or Melbourne, then flying is your only realistic option. Virgin and Jetstar run daily flights direct to Canberra from those spots for reasonable prices, particularly if you book months in advance. You can get buses from Melbourne for pretty cheap but they?re overnight and it?s a long ride.

Just to add since you asked what we do. Brisbane - fly always. Sydney - drive except if for international travel (then bus) or work (fly, since I?m not paying). Melbourne - fly except for extended stays to visit family (then drive).",Canberra

"**Canberra Universities Face Governance Crisis in 2024**  
  
The year just gone was nothing short of an annus horribilis for Canberra's two major universities.

The University of Canberra kicked off the controversy with the sudden resignation of vice-chancellor Professor Paddy Nixon for ""personal reasons"".

While he tendered his resignation in December 2023, his departure was not made public until January 17, 2024. In his final year, he took home a package worth $1.8 million.

As the year unfolded, it became clear the university was not on sound financial footing. By August, then interim vice-chancellor Lucy Johnston told staff a $26 million forecast deficit for the year had grown to $36 million.

A restructure involving axing more than 200 jobs will continue into 2025. A succession of two more interim vice-chancellors has left the impression of chaotic leadership and a loss of confidence in the university's governing body.

Meanwhile, a similarly dire picture was building at the Australian National University.

After the ANU claimed it had successive years of deficits into the hundreds of millions of dollars, the university launched Renew ANU. The aggressive cost-cutting program was set up to cut ongoing expenses in the order of $250 million by 2026.

Consultancy firm Nous was brought on to lead the ANU restructure, but university executives have come under fire for their approach to staff consultation.

The university has begun slimming down its payroll - with estimates of up to 636 jobs to go - but has a long road to go to achieve the ambitious savings targets.

Vice-chancellor Genevieve Bell is only one year into her tenure and already facing calls to resign after it was revealed she had a paid part-time role at Intel until November.

The service was a little clumsy. There was no identifiable sommelier on hand, and the tasting menu was almost offensively meagre for the price.

"OK, here's my 28 year saga with grass in Canberra...

In 1999, scarabs killed our lawn, along with everybody else's. We returfed with Canturf Canberra Blend with clover. It was OK, but needed a lot of water. In the early 00s drought, water restrictions meant we couldn't water, and the lawn died, along with everybody else's.

After the drought, we returfed with Sir Walter (Buffalo). (IIRC, the ACT government mandated that grass in Gungahlin had to be Sir Walter.)

Sir Walter was excellent. It needed less water, and a LOT LESS mowing than Canberra Blend. One downside was that it went brown over winter, which some people don't like. I consider this an advantage, because the weeds come out in spring earlier than Sir Walter starts up, so it's easy to see the weeds, and pull them out by hand, lessening the need for any chemicals later. Another downside is that it doesn't do as well under shade. It likes full sun.

Then we had to get some work done, and the contractor replaced that part of the lawn with Canberra Blend. I asked him why he didn't match the other grass, and he said he didn't like that Sir Walter goes brown in winter. (The choice of grass wasn't something I thought I needed to specify.)

Once again, the Canberra Blend part of the lawn needed more water and more mowing.

To end up, we got some chooks, and let them out in the afternoons. They ate, and killed, all the Sir Walter. (They liked the roots.) They didn't touch the Canberra Blend at all.

Before we sold the house, we returfed it all with Sir Walter, but... Canturf doesn't sell it anymore. We bought it from a supplier on the coast, who delivered to Canberra.

Tl;dr: Sir Walter (Buffalo) is better. It needs less water, mowing and weeding.",Canberra
"In my teens and 20s I went to Summernats every year for about a decade from 1986 onwards. Saw the 3 or 4 B's in abundance. The desperation of many of the guys to see women topless feels cringier the more time passes. 

Then in '94 I went to the Bathurst 1000 for the first time. Holy shit .... Summernats behaviour pales in comparison to Mt Panorama that weekend. I made the mistake of going with 3 female friends who were keen to see what the weekend was all about. At one point through the Friday night up on the mountain I had to essentially put myself between them and half a dozen guys surrounding us demanding they bare their chests.

"Purely speculative, but having lived in other areas that were tipped to get ""big new shopping centres"", at a guess I would say 5 years before the Kippax Centre is fully finished. That includes the shops part, but also the obligatory high-rise apartments above.  The shops there now aren't too bad, but lacking in some areas. On the plus side, it's still close enough to the Mall or Jamison if you want to do a big shop. Probably not the worst time to buy either, as I imagine prices in the area might go up once it's all finished. 

As for the tram, if it ever happens you'd be looking at 15+ years I'd guess. Stage 3 might link Tuggers to Woden, and a straight line from Gunners to Tuggers makes sense. Unfortunately, Belconnen is off to the side and would need to join up to the City, meaning more infrastructure reworks etc.  There would also need to be some significant infrastructure works between Kippax and Belconnen to accommodate the tram. The best option is likely straight down Southern Cross, but in addition to having to open up more space to fit the tram (or close one lane each way, which would go down a treat), you also have to cross Kingsford Smith and Caswell.  

From Belconnen the obvious route is Belconnen Way or Ginninderra Dr, which would both need re-routing services as the town centre sits between the two, unless it cut down College St past UC and onto Hayden Dr. Either of those routes would need quite a lot of work to add more space. I don't see Radford giving up any land, and the NIMBY folks in Aranda/Oconnor would go a bit crazy again if any infrastructure was proposed to go past them. And all of that doesn't take into account the shenanigans involved with crossing GDE. 

Connecting Belconnen to the tram is an awful lot of work for minimal payoff, considering there's already great bus route that can make use of the existing bus lanes. Dollar-for-dollar, an electric bus service from Belconnen to City makes much more sense, even if you had to run overhead charging cables. If they really wanted to streamline it, they could build little addons to existing roads/bridges etc that could allow buses to bypass all the traffic lights.

"Be careful about the housing quality in Canberra. For a city that gets as cold as Canberra does, a lot of ""affordable"" houses haven't been built to handle it. Consider how cold indoor temperatures could affect your conditions (including mental health) or whether you can afford a well built property with efficient heating. Very small apartments which aren't too old are about the only option if you want ""affordable"" and energy efficient.

"So, OP, here's something for you to check.

Within 90 minutes of Civic at least (90 minutes changes a lot if it's 90 minutes to Spence or 90 minutes to Calwell ..) prices don't generally drop that much. Additionally the 'best country towns' tend to be premium locations and premium properties for the most part.

Then, you need to consider the savings in real estate versus the potentially increased costs everywhere else. Fuel and car maintenance and depreciation. In a lot of these locations you might be off town water or sewage and need to take responsibility for some of your own services. Prices of goods and services are often higher. I'd also be asking about how you value your time - in terms of the number of extra hours you lose a week. And safety too - time and kilometres on some of the roads in question increases risk as those roads, their conditions and the drivers ... aren't great. And every time you write off a car on a wombat, that's not cheap or convenient either - especially when your whole lifestyle is critically car-dependent.

I recommend doing a total cost of living spreadsheet and thinking it through. It may actually cost more to live in a cheaper property ...

And then there's potentially isolation from social activities and facilities.

Anyway, think it through properly!",Canberra

"I have recently gone through a 75kg weight loss :) 

It started with seeing a bariatric GP Dr Jung Le-Qui at Barton General Practice. She worked in sync with my bariatric surgeon who I had a gastric bypass done through. 

Side note she is amazing and super lovely! She helped diagnose me with my Hypothyroidism and PCOS prior to surgery which was huge, as docs just blamed it on my prior weight and told me to lose weight. She is very much aware most of the time it?s not your fault you are overweight, there will be some underlying medical condition and mental health causing it. 

However it?s not all about the surgery. They have like 10 different weight loss ?tools? for you to obtain info on, gastric bypass is one tool, Ozempic or injections are another etc. 

You can work with Dr Le Qui by obtaining testing to see where your body is, she will put you in a eating disorder plan so you can claim psychologist and dietician fees through Medicare and will refer you onto a team as mentioned above to change the way you view food, and provide support as a whole team. 

It?s best to obtain all the info you can and make an informed decision on which tool is right for you to assist you in your weight loss. I chose Saxenda initially and I lost 20kgs that way before I went down the surgical path.

"The ACT's Heritage Council has been granted more time to consider ""complex issues"" before deciding whether to grantÿpermanent protection to a section of Canberra's oldest shops.

The council received about 50 submissions during the public consultation period on the registration of the Kingston shops.

The council sought ministerial approval for more time to consider the registration, telling members of the public who had made submissions it needed more time to ""resolve complex issues in relation to public consultation submissions on the place, being satisfied on reasonable grounds the initial period will end before Council is able to resolve the issues"".

An ACT government spokeswoman said the complexity was the number of submissions received.

""The initial provisional registration period, ending 28 February 2025, will not allow The Heritage Council adequate time to prepare a report on public consultation for the Minister's consideration, without the decision lapsing,"" the spokeswoman said.

""The extension will allow more time for the Council to engage with stakeholders to discuss their individual submissions where required.""

The provisional registration period has been extended until May 27.

A section of shops on Giles Street and Kennedy Street inÿKingstonÿwere provisionally registered for protection by the ACT Heritage Council in June 2024.

Heritage Council chair Duncan Marshall at the time said the council had considered three nominations that had covered larger parts of the Kingston shops precinct before settling on a provisional registration for a smaller section of shops from the area's original development.

""These shops were the first fully formed shopping precinct in Canberra. They were essential for goods and services, but they were also a centre for socialising and employment,"" Mr Marshall said.

The Heritage Council said the registration would not stop current or sympathetic new uses of the buildings.

""In the case of the early Kingston shops, it is worth noting the similar situation with the Sydney and Melbourne Buildings which have been on the ACT Heritage Register since 1997, and they continue to be used and sympathetically adapted when necessary,"" the council said.

But Greater Canberra, a community group which lobbies for more housing in the ACT, encouraged its members to oppose heritage registration for the shops.

The group said the shops had changed significantly since they were built and held little heritage value.

""The listed shops are similar to many other Canberra shops - they are not uniquely important to the ACT's cultural history, and so are not worthy of heritage listing,"" the group said in a list of suggested points to make in a submission to the Heritage Council.

The group said blocking redevelopment of ageing shops through heritage registration would cut future residents out of the benefits of improved amenities.

"I?ve been almost entirely onsite before, during and since the scamdemic across a few different private sector workplaces.

There were a few weeks over the summer of 2020/2021 where, following a redundancy in Canberra I was commuting to Sydney for work, and was forced to work from home due to a border closure. My work doesn?t translate well to working offsite and it was a frustrating few weeks. Getting back onsite was a relief, as was then finding work in Canberra again and losing the long commute and Sydney accomodation.

I?ve never really liked working from home. Even with jobs where it was perfectly feasible. It blurs the boundaries between home and work far too much.",Canberra
"I think Civic sorely needs more residents and there's a lot that could be done to revitalise areas around Garema Place, and to get carparking underground or multideck. But I really hope good design is at the forefront! There are some really badly designed apartment buildings in the Belconnen town centre, the Dickson Coles, etc, where they don't do anything to activate the ground level or create connection and engagement with the community -- solid brick wall frontages on active pedestrian areas is madness. Precincts like New Acton are a bit better with integrated green areas but those are largely a product of heritage restrictions. Then there is the poor apartment design -- create better buildings so that apartments aren't all the same, lacking in natural light, cramped, are accessible, accommodate people with pets and/or kids etc. The aspiration to grow the population needs to be met with aspiration for the types of developments allowed to go ahead -- the government needs to push back until we get good design and exciting precincts.",Canberra

Unfortunately this left my little family without a car, waiting to be paid.

Worst? Well ... some of the more far flung areas would mean you'd have to rely on having a car all the time ... which is the case in a lot of Australian suburbia.

The centre is intended to be an immersive sound and picture scape of life in the city. I would stay longer and watch the projections longer if I went again, listening out for things.ÿ

It?s definitely the least comprehensive of the exhibitions I?ve seen but glad I went.ÿ",Canberra
"The Dickson store is now run by a family (and mainly just one member of that family) with school-aged children, so there?s often extended closures through school holidays. That said, the sign on the door does say it was supposed to reopen last week, but it hasn?t yet. I don?t know if they?ve decided to take a longer break or if there?s another reason.",Canberra
I got charged $25 for a particular test at Gungahlin Capital Pathology about a year ago. I got the same test done at Laverty Gungahlin (right next to it) about 2 weeks ago and wasn?t charged at all. I know where I?m going from now on,Canberra

"Accepting and loving doesn?t mean affirming and approving. Plenty of gospel focused, accepting and loving churches across the ACT. 
If your friend is an Anglican, St Matt?s Wanniassa is great. I?m not sure if Ian Powell is there still but he is an awesome minister both pastorally and theologically. Located at Trinity school.

Crossroads are non-denominational but gospel focused with many different leader backgrounds. They struggle to support the individual due to their size but they have an exceptional home group setup and young person evening church at ANU.

Northside has a few different denominations but gungahlin Anglican, while smaller than crossroads and St Matt?s, has a supportive and welcoming community of older folks and families.",Canberra
"I?ve had great service at Nick Scali Fyshwick. I ordered a couch that has a ?zero gravity? recliner; if you can get into the store, ask to try one; it raises your feet above your head and you feel like you?re floating.

The Cricket sporting associations and clubs have been complaining loudly, and regularly about the mowing standards for years. Our club has been complaining because they don't cut the grass to their own specifications, constantly miss deadlines or just don't mow the fields at all - and it's not weather related.

The Government doesn't want to act upon it. They won't even talk to us about it.

We already do minor to medium sized repairs ourselves (and out of our own pockets), but trying to get the Government to act, or really do anything in this space is incredibly frustrating.

Our club and members have even offered to supply all equipment, hold relevant insurances ourselves and cut cricket ovals ourselves to their own specifications - completely out of our own money, and taking the burden off the Government.",Canberra

"They?re not something you see around much because you can?t just make them with normal milk unfortunately as they split and go really gross.  I would recommend maybe trying to make something similar at home with some ice cream, ice and whatever coffee you like and just chuck it all in a blender. If it doesn?t work, it will make a really good thick shake without the ice.

Also I know it?s not exactly what you want but if you go to a cafe that does milkshakes and thick shakes they can probably add some espresso? If you don?t like it too sweet just vanilla ice cream with no syrups and espresso makes a lovely thick shake.",Canberra
"The best non-specialty bookshop is Canty's in Fyshwick. If you're out there you can find some great food places in the area (like Mr Papa). Dirty Janes is a pretty cool vintage/antique market thing.

I hate parking at Cancon so will probably go excessively early and get breakfast at the [farmers market](https://capitalregionfarmersmarket.com.au/this-week-at-the-market/) - also good if you need a souvenir for someone back home since you can buy some local truffle oil or gin or something. On that same note, there's a shop in Braddon called POP Canberra that's all locally made stuff.

There is no point visiting any gaming or hobby store during Cancon since half of them will be closed and have their stock at Cancon anyway. Don't miss the bring and buy, for that Saturday it's probably the best second-hand tabletop gaming store in the hemisphere.

In terms of hidden gems, if you end up in Dickson for a meal at any point, the best burgers in the city are from the tiny Mafia Buns van. The Jangdokdae van in Turner is likewise probably the best Korean food.",Canberra

"yeah, I've been messed around a bunch of times by Capital. They always say the gap will be ""around $50"" and then it's always more. Got billed nearly $200 out of pocket last year, and when I raised it with them I got pages of explanation and also a defensive line about how ACT pathology is subsidised by the ACT government (in which case, as a ratepayer, I should probably use them...). All I asked was that their front desk staff get more guidance about the likely final cost of the tests they were doing.

At any rate, echo what other folks have been saying - ACT pathology is way better, though the one at the hospital is really difficult to find parking for. Also if you use myDHR your results get sent directly through to it by ACTpath, usually the same or next day, whereas Capital are really slow and in some cases never sent them.",Canberra

"How did we get here? 

Years of chronic underfunding,   
Poor quality degrees in some subject areas, - bad design, weak assessment strategies, average  to weak teaching  
Poor quality admissions standards  
Too much competition across the sector  
Senior management without strategic understanding of how to run a university

We need  
Increased external oversight and decent inspection processes from TEQSA (look to QAA for examples of how it could be done) not year on year cuts to the only regulator the sector has.  
Academics on either teaching only contracts or research only contracts - do one thing well  
More mergers e,g, UNISA and Uni Adelaide - good start  
Better support for regional higher education i.e. fewer or no HE free areas   
Closer integration with TAFE in subjects such as engineering/teaching/nurse education (the polytechnic/Higher technical college model worked well). Teacher trainers don't need PhDs they need skills and experience in the sector they are providing training for  
Most art subjects do not belong in universities, there should be seperate art schools (NAS Sydney for example) as it used to be rather than faux academic posturing.  
Make a few universities post-graduate only (Group of 8 and one or two others) the rest could easily lose a lot of their PhD programs without any great disadvantage",Canberra

If some dickhead doesn't stop for me when I've got right of way, then I don't really care that they're being a dick. I just wait, ignore them and then move on.

Regrettably, the HRC itself has serious systemic ableism, racism, sexism issues.   Which as far as I can tell haven?t been addressed or mitigated yet.   

It only affects a minority of people, the most vulnerable and disenfranchised.   Very unbecoming the HRC throws them under the bus!      

I (stupidly!) lodged a HRC against ACT Police last year.  To bring the litany of horrific gaps to the attention of someone higher up within ACT Police.  So for those after me, their survival
doesn?t depend on random strangers while authorities are failing. 

ACT Police didn?t wanna participate, the HRC cannot compel them.  
But as a ?bonus? detailed police documents of what I reported when, letter from the Deputy Police Commissioner, etc etc:   The HRC accidentally posted it all to my insanely and dangerously unhinged ex! 

He wanted me dead 5-6 years ago, assuming I had never gone to police.   
So 6 years after physical separation and subsequent divorce **I** am the one behind cameras, movement sensors, the whole shebang.   Again!   

Yet again, I am not leaving my fortress on my own.   Yet again, authorities f?cking up in way which are astounding!    
And,:   Yet again the system abuse has amped up galore, and there?s nothing I can do to stop it.   Also yet again!    

If a survivor has been screaming from the rooftops for over half a decade:    
Wouldn?t it be great if at some point someone would risk-manage the perpetrator?   
If it weren?t the survivor on de-facto house arrest?  

If at the *VERY* least at some point the survivor could stop his system abuse??.?

"How long is a piece of string? We have a few rentals and my experience has been that it's not as competitive/dirty/cutthroat...etc as many people think. However when a unicorn property comes up, people all flock to it and get all butt-hurt as they are like 'that was MINE and the process was UNFAIR!!!'  
  
Our places are central and new/clean but we charge market rate so there's never a flood of desperate applicants. My experience is that we usually get 1 or 2 within the first couple of weeks and just go with the first one.  
  
If tenants leave early and the place is in a pretty ordinary condition then part of the risk of enterprise is that we sometimes have to go without rent for a few months while finding somebody.  
  
Interestingly, some of our places in more affordable suburbs rent better than ones in more competitive suburbs. My first home is a ripper as I bought it for fuck all while living outta my car (following a messy divorce + stack of mental health issues). It's in a cheaper town centre but for whatever reason it rents particularly well.

"Whatever issue you're having, it's probably not going to be resolved solely through physio appts. They email you exercises so that you can continue the (healing) process on your own. It might look ""generic"" cause the images are pulled from a database but the PT is going to be selecting specific ones for your specific issue. I don't think that's unusual at all. IIRC it's not within the scope of practice of a PT to diagnose an issue, you would need to see a dr for that which is probably why they arent using diagnostic imaging equipment (eg. ultrasound). Some PT clinics have a dr on staff who can offer that service, though even if it is the PT or assistant actually doing the imaging. The official diagnosis comes from the dr.ÿ

Physio is usually several appts + exercises to do at home. It's not really a ""go once and you're cured!"" type thing.

Not Kanata but - I went to Ottawa Physiotherapy & Sports Clinic (they have a bunch of locations in city - I went to the Westboro location) and had a great experience.

I smell the downstairs neighbours cooking when I?m in my laundry room, because I share that floor with them (I have a half story and two stories above, they have a half story and two floors below?we?re on a hill, the geometry works). They probably hear my laundry sounds below, but I do not hear my next door neighbour?s laundry.

I would like to see some real transit priority for buses on Rideau, Bank, and Montreal, and aggressive enforcement against drivers who impede transit operations.

But by all means let's go another few hundred million dollars in debt building suburban LRTs instead of bringing better transit service to the neighborhoods and residents where transit investment is most warranted and most needed.",Ottawa

Landsdowne has reasons outside of drinking to visit. I went there to see a movie, saw a football game, Christmas market and went to a couple of concerts.",Ottawa
"Bonjour !

Vous semblez avoir une bonne compr‚hension de ces thŠmes. Un seul d‚tail, Ottawa/Gatineau est … cheval sur la frontiŠre Ontario/Qu‚bec, la fa‡on dont les choses fonctionnent d'un c“t‚ de la frontiŠre peut ˆtre complŠtement diff‚rente de l'autre c“t‚ de la frontiŠre. Imaginez une ville qui est … moiti‚ en Wallonie et en Flandre.

De fa‡on g‚n‚rale, les services municipaux d'Ottawa et de Gatineau collaborent entre eux (par exemple: transport en commun et bibliothŠques). C'est tout le contraire pour les services provinciaux, il n'y a aucune coordination. Par exemple, pour un enfant de 4 ans, du c“t‚ ontarien, vous avez la maternelle dans le r‚seau scolaire, du c“t‚ qu‚b‚cois, il y a un excellent r‚seau de garderie publique (ce sont les CPE ""centre de la petite enfance"", le terme crŠche n'est pas vraiment utilis‚ ici … l'exception de ce que vous mettez sous votre sapin de No‰l !). La maternelle commence , de fa‡on g‚n‚rale, … 5 ans au Qu‚bec (il y a de la maternelle 4 ans, mais ce n'est pas la norme).

Pour des raisons historiques et politiques, les services gouvernementaux (… l'exception des ‚coles) sont surtout en fran‡ais du c“t‚ qu‚b‚cois, bien que la majorit‚ du personnel parle anglais; du c“t‚ ontarien, les services sont surtout en anglais avec une offre variable et al‚atoire en fran‡ais.",Ottawa

"Plus size?ÿ

There are a crap ton of great slow fashion brands which are size inclusive. Some of a bit wild, a lot is fairly simple. Made in Canada and many offer customization.

Free label: elevated basics, slightly tailored options as well.

Anne Mulaire: dresses, office wear, casual options, some athletic options. Indigenous owned.ÿ

Nettle?s Tale: elevated basics, nice buttondowns, REALLY nice swimwear.ÿ

Buttercream clothing: elevated basics but they do usually have a good range of colours.ÿ

These are all brands I have bought from and are awesome. All these brands fit test in their largest sizes (6x usually) and they are super awesome.ÿ

Brands I have no direct experience with but I have heard amazing things about:

Loud Bodies is from the UK. Super girly and femme but also really nice.ÿ

Emperor?s New Clothing also from the UK full custom. You pick every feature and it?s made to order.ÿ

Thief and bandit is in Halifax and does their own silk screening. Some of their prints are on the geeky side.ÿ

Suay is out of LA (yeah I know) but they are legitimately amazing people. They?ve been diverting textile waste from all the crap donations post LA fires and have saved 50 tons of waste from needing to be landfilled in the past couple of weeks. All their stuff is upcycled and really great looking.ÿ

There are a lot of others out there too. I know a bunch of African and European brands do sizes to order and I know there are at least two brands out of TO who are plus size only.ÿ

I know there are a bunch of locals who take commissions locally so you can find whatever fabric you like and go from there. Unfortunately I?m out of touch cause my person stopped a couple of years back so I learned to sew myself.ÿ

Lastly if you want to learn yourself Fabrications on Carling has very good classes. I know most of the teachers and they are good. Plus the staff know plus size pattern options well and can be super helpful.",Ottawa

"You should try using a Canva template to reorganize your resume and to make your skills clearer. A summary and skills section would help, in my opinion. You can tailor these sections to each job, e.g. if you are applying to a customer or sales position, you would highlight your customer service experience. 

Something like this: [https://www.canva.com/templates/EAFVMYAsx-k-black-and-white-minimalistic-simple-resume/](https://www.canva.com/templates/EAFVMYAsx-k-black-and-white-minimalistic-simple-resume/)

A smaller one by the front doors where ppl drive their car to check in. It?s maybe a bear and moose. 

And a larger one to the side of the front entrance, closer to the hotel restaurant . It?s a life size ice couch, armchair, side table with an ice carving bust of a chef. 

Approx 3-4 on Sparks and another in front of the War Memorial. 

There are more planned for next weekend and through out the festival. 

Like a previous commenter said, last year the weather was unseasonably warm and all the ice sculptures melted, some even before they could be finished. 

A compromise this year was to stagger the carvers in case another warm spell comes through. 

Also last year there were two (maybe more) extremely large snow carvings at the park in Gatineau where the man made sledding hill is and family activities happen. They were impressive bc of their size and detail. One was easily 10 feet tall.

"More than prescribing one option or another - cars off Bank, bikes off Bank, shared bikes and buses lanes, etc - what's important is for the City to go back to the drawing board and not arbitrarily exclude moving parking off of Bank from its options, at it has.

So, it's not the job of activists to dictate exactly what the final form of the transformation of Bank Street looks like, but rather to hold the City's (and the BIA's) feet to the fire to call on them to take into serious consideration design solutions that move some, or all, of the parking off of Bank Street, to open it up to higher uses.",Ottawa

"It will be interesting to see the OREB January report in a few days, but so far it seems like the year is off to a flat start - based on this week's data, we are entering February with the median sold price for freeholds under $700,000 and condos under $400,000. 

While we all breath a sigh of relief to know that Trump's tariffs will not be implemented tomorrow, the fact that we are not even two weeks into his 4 year term means that volatility is the name of the game moving forward. Buckle up! 

As a half-joke, half-serious question - why are San Pellegrino bottles so prevalent in staging? It's become a meme at this point whenever I see those [three wretched San Pellegrino](https://canadianhometrends.com/staging-is-just-common-sense/) bottles on the kitchen counter. Anyways, back to regular business:

* In this week?s episode of condo carnage, I present [Unit 204 - 151 Bay St N](https://housesigma.com/on/ottawa-real-estate/204-151-bay-st-n/home/L4KAX7NXWMoYeRPJ/). This 2 bed, 2 bath condo with parking in Centretown just sold for $332,000 - $13,000 less than it last sold for in 2019, and $97,000 less than it sold for in 2022. This is a large unit (980 sq ft) has rather high condo fees at $1,001 a month (albeit those include heat, water, hydro and sewer). Hard to imagine paying that much in condo fees and still need to rely in shared coin laundry (none in-unit). It?s also worth noting this building has been engulfed by the neighbouring Claridge towers next door above the Lyon LRT station.
* In spite of all the economic uncertainty, the luxury market is HOT! [685 Denbury Ave](https://housesigma.com/on/ottawa-real-estate/685-denbury-ave/home/MWBVyZ9dWEKYKemj/) that I shared last week ended up selling for a whopping $511,000 above ask at $2.3 M (plus a cool $15,000 a year in property tax). [10 Rothwell Dr](https://housesigma.com/on/orleans-gloucester-real-estate/10-rothwell-drive/home/NkKJ3JdN9Peyd4V6/), a luxury property on a full acre in Rothwell Heights sold for $2.75 M on the same day ($350,000 under asking price). This just once again goes to show, asking price means nothing! The market decides what a home is worth, not your feelings.
* [2083 Lenester Ave](https://housesigma.com/on/ottawa-real-estate/2083-lenester-ave/home/GMnKYqpaLpR3w1Qr?id_listing=gAaOyLKpzWzYGxMb), a 4 bed detached home in Glabar Park just sold firm in 2 days for $818,000. Notably, this was an estate sale that has not completed probate yet ? I have noticed as a general rule that if you can be flexible with your closing date, estate sales are where the deals are (as bad as it sounds).
* [22 Pacing Walk Rd](https://housesigma.com/on/stittsville-goulbourn-real-estate/22-pacing-walk-rd/home/10QqypNaPW13LGlV?id_listing=ZxwR7MVrO1z3KabB), a 1 year old new build detached home in Richmond is already back up for sale ?as-is, where-is.? Super odd to see that on such a new home. Power of sale perhaps?

"I?m on propane (Stinson), not natural gas, but prices were through the roof when I needed my tanks filled a few weeks ago.

Normally I can make it Sept to March before refilling ? I have a heat pump and a propane furnace as auxiliary heat ? but I had to refill earlier this month because the cold snap meant I was using the aux heat more. Propane was $1.03/L, whereas this time last year it was $0.83/L. Surge pricing, I suppose. Cost to fill two tanks was just shy of $1000.

"The games in late March, early April will likely be a lot cheaper.  

Columbus, Tampa Bay, Florida, and Buffalo.  They don't draw like the Leafs, Canadiens, Jets do so the tickets will be quite a bit cheaper.  

Some folks park at the Palladium Auto Park and walk.  A bit nippy when it's -30 but should be fine in the spring.  Saves a bit on parking that way.  The downside is the long wait to exit if you stay the entire game.",Ottawa
"Yes, that is normal. The Civic delivers the most babies in the city and there?s a mix of high risk patients and patients that see OBs/MFMs throughout the city who deliver at the hospital/see patients there so the volume is high. It can take awhile to get a call because they need to make sure they have a room ready to admit you. They may also call you to start an outpatient process. If that?s the case, and if this is your first baby, be prepared for this to be lengthy (up to 5 days) because cervical ripening can take time and you might need a few options administered (like prostaglandin, cervidil, etc.)to get contractions going. 

Even though you?re high risk, please know that if it was emergent, you would be a higher priority. I know it can be a really stressful time but take this time to rest as much as you can, have your hospital bag and snacks ready to go and be prepared for it to take awhile. I?d suggest bringing a long phone charger, some entertainment and headphones to cancel out noise because it?s really hard trying to sleep there with everything going on.

"Retail businesses need to get better at evolving to consumer needs, wants, etc. And they also need to become better at pricing accessibility, and if most small business owners started negotiating better contracts from their suppliers, they can collectively bargain for better pricing from the huge suppliers making record profits, or alternatively - local source from smaller suppliers and help each other grow.

"I currently live at the twin building at 21 James also owned by Sleepwell. I?ve been living here since June 2024, and despite not being 420 Gilmore I imagine the experience is somewhat the same. Here is my experience so far;

The good:
- the unit is large, bright, and fully equipped. I live in a 1 bed unit on the 8th floor facing South. The views are immaculate and the sunset is great. I?m
sure you can say the same for Gilmore depending on the direction you face 
- large stainless steel fridge, stove, range microwave, and washer/dryer combo. 
- large balcony
- optional underground parking
- extra laundry room
- party room
- building is generally kept clean during the week
- issues are generally addressed quickly when requested
- very quiet; I rarely hear neighbours on my floor. The walls are thick  

The bad:

- rent is high as expected
- some repairs are left unfinished; I had a light bulb underneath my range go out that the repair guy said was ?siliconed in? by another tenant. Has not been addressed since
- garbage area constantly in disarray
- inconvenient repair time windows; 8am-5pm 
- water shutoff seemingly with or without warning
- homeless issue; as sensitive as a topic it is, it?s difficult not to address. The building and general area are simply bursting at the seams with drug addicts and homeless individuals. In winter, it is frequent to find someone camping, having a mental health episode or doing drugs in the partition between the outdoors and the interior lobby of the building. Sometimes tenants seemingly allow them access to the interior of the building where it becomes a security risk. I have contacted Sleepwell countless times about the issue with little being done. They sent out an email blast informing residents of 420 Gilmore and 21 James that a new security system would be installed to help prevent trespassing. This was sent in early December, I was told it would be done by the end of January, and as of now it still isn?t done. 

All in all it?s a solid building, but I?ll be moving out come summer time. The area itself has been ruined, you?re better off looking around the Golden Triangle.",Ottawa

The newer technologists all either temporarily moved to Kingston (like me - two years there for school and then back to Ottawa for a year for placement) or they are from somewhere else like Toronto and relocated to Ottawa for work after completing school. 

We keep hoping Algonquin might someday bring the program back because of shortages in our field. But it's extremely expensive to implement due to the necessary lab equipment so I'm not holding my breath.

Just anecdotally from passing by, both fields have seen far more use outside of school hours now that they are not hard baked dirt.  I walk by Connaught fairly frequently, and late into the Fall every evening there would be one or two goups of kids using the field, when it used to be pretty lightly used.

This produces kids who are more inclined to take cognitive and emotional risks in the classroom and in the real world.

Honestly, think about the attributes you think a future employer would want. They want someone who takes smart risks and thinks outside the box. Think about the attributes you as a member of society wants for the next generation. You want someone who is creative and compassionate and communicative.


These are the attributes that are cultivated in our alternative schools. And this is why-- among all the other changes that are being suggested--alternative schools within the OCDSB should be not just protected, but cherished.


Edited to add: they are assessed and get report cards like every other Ontario student. They just don't see those grades in their day to day.ÿ",Ottawa

"I?m beginning to think that theres several things happening here when trump threaten tariffs: (1) America doesn?t have money to patrol their own boarders and coercive tactics for Mexico and Canada to patrol their boards; (2) using tariffs to gamble at taking a stab at resolving a potential fall of their own economy to try to recoup taxes to reduce their national debt (that is w/o counter tariffs in place), to protect their national security, meaning a potential fall of their economy. 

Here?s what i understand of their current situation. US debt ceiling is 50 trillion dollars. They?re presently sitting close to 38 trillion dollars. 

Tariffs imposed on Canada (w/o counter tariffs) would have potentially brought in ~1.7 trillion worth of taxes per yr.

You can set up appts with them, and they will be able to give you actual feedback on your resume, CV, interview, and LinkedIn page.. etc. The person I worked with gave me a lot of really good feedback.

In terms of your resume, I would personally put a short paragraph describing yourself because it's often unclear to the reader what your background is and what you're looking for. For example, something like ""an adaptive digital illustrator with x years of experience in customer service and x years in animation is looking for x position"".

For the descriptions under your different roles, I would try to describe the results and provide a quantitative description. For example, ""provided outstanding customer service by x,y,z resulted in positive feedback from customers via google reviews, word of mouth, etc.""

You can also list any technical skills, i.e. programming, MS Excel, Adobe Illustrator.. etc.

Some employers will use AST to filter through the resumes. So you kind of need two types on hand, one for human eyes and one for the AI to pick up ""keywords"".

It is a lot easier to get an interview if you have a connection because most companies will look at those referrals first before going through the big file of resumes (noted that it doesn't guarantee a job), so I would also suggest finding mentors, going to social events, asking people you know, taking training courses (also put them on your resume! to show you are open to learning).

If you are in crisis call either 911 or 988. 

What?s a crisis? I don?t know what that is for you. Me? Well with help of several of Ontario?s finest mental health professionals I was able to develop a crisis plan. In it for me, are several steps that I can do to resolve things so that things do not need to get to a hospital trip. 

People live with devastating effects of their mental health challenges every single day. I do. So start figuring yourself out. Talk to someone.

The ED is there to keep you alive. Are you in danger? Or are you still capable? You see you are going to have to live with your brain for as long as you are alive. So take care of it. Act. Call someone. Do you have family, friends, I don?t know, some sort of trusted mentor? anyone you can talk to?

I know it is hard. I?ve done it. Just call someone. 

Have you done any research, or are you incapable of taking care of yourself? (Sorry sounds too rough, but it must be plainly said). These are things you are going to have to ask yourself right now. Because there?s no cure for wanting to die. And going to the ED isn?t going to fix it, they are just going to bubble wrap you until they can get you off of their ledgers. Then you do all the work. So what do you want to do? 

Remember that: if you need protection or if others need protection from you then you need to go to the Emergency Room. Call 911/988.

Is this an emergency? If so go to ER. If not start at a doctor?s office for a referral. You have Family Doctor? Yes? Well? No? Well I know that getting a GP is a whole other kettle of fish? but your family doctor is your expert navigator through the system. And they can lead you to wherever you wish to go. 

By the way, it?s hard to form someone (form = slang for having someone committed). It isn?t done lightly. If they feel you need to be committed, then I?m thinking that it?s in everyone?s best interests. The ED doesn?t want you there. They don?t need to justify their jobs. They are hoping that the world is perfect and that they are not needed anymore. Nobody wants you as a patient, so if you want to get better, may I suggest you call someone now and get to work. 

But I don?t know you. This may be engagement bait, and if so, then bravo. But if not, then get to work. Start by talking to someone who MATTERS not some random Redditter. 

If you are worried able yourself then please call the distress centre at 613-238-3311.

If you need clothing you can also contact Dress for Success in Ottawa and you will get a private appointment to shop there (everything is free for you) - I have donated there for years and sent some staff there who needed it and all seemed to enjoy the experience. 

I've hired employees from CVE Inc. in the past and it has been a good experience since the employees are continually supported throughout their employment. You can use them as a go-between to make sure you are supported, have accommodations in place to be successful etc. Also I assume they help with resumes and writing them since I received resumes which were professionally written by people who did not have the language skills to have done so themselves (but who did great work and were a good fit for the roles they were hired for). I assume they can help you.

"More history involved?.back in the late 70s the City of Ottawa essentially pushed all the farmers out by allowing resellers to fetch produce from the Montreal food terminal and pretend they were farmers and sell at Byward and Parkdale.  Bananas should have been the telltale for fraud.

I think there are six? Real farmers? markets run by them.  For sure Lansdowne and westboro are the most successful.

You can tell that by how the City and OSEG brand their own markets with very similar and deceptive names.

Unfortunately all markets abandoned their customers by closing during COVID.

"Welcome to Ottawa!

FWIW, personally, I don't put a lot of weight in the school rankings because I don't think they reflect the schools that well (I know that some schools practice the tests with students, many don't - everything else being the same, it's reasonable to believe that schools that practice will get better results.  And for socio-economic reasons, some schools have a lot more students who's first language is not english / french or where parents are not able to help students with school work and / or can't afford private tutors so typically those schools will not do nearly as well).  One of our sons goes to a school that scores very poorly for those reasons but the school and staff are great.

Being francophone, I'm probably a bit biased but for schooling, if your children already speak French and you want them to remain bilingual, I think you are MUCH better off sending your children to a french school board school rather than an English school board school.  If your child goes to a French school, they will be fully bilingual.  If they go to an English school board school, even if they do French immersion, they will likely not be bilingual unless they speak a lot of French outside the school (Although I'm not a teacher so I'm not totally in the loop, I would go as far to say that a HighSchool level English class at a French school is at a similar level / difficulty to a HighSchool level English class at an English school but the converse is not the same. I believe a HighSchool level French class at an English school is significantly ""lower level"" than a HighSchool level French class at a French school).  Also, having one child in the French board and one in the English board, the French board seems to be stronger academically.  Similarly, it seems to be that the Catholic board schools (English and French) might be a bit stronger than the Public board schools (again, I think the Public board schools get a higher percentage of students whose first language is not English or French or who may not have the same schooling which have an impact on the pace of lessons in the classroom).  If they do attend a French school board, I believe most (all?) of their schools have optional 1/2 day program (pr‚-maternelle) for 3 year olds followed by full-day JK (maternelle) and SK (jardin) but your kids might be past that age anyway.

As far as Lyc‚e Claudel, I knew a few people that went there and academically, at the time at least, it was quite a bit stronger academically but I would also have to say that socially, I think everyone I know that went there, had some social issues.  FWIW, I never even considered sending our kids there.  Also, while there are benefits to strong academic schools, it's not for everyone and it does put a lot of pressure on the students.   I know of strong students that had terrible experiences in IB programs (specially at Colonel By which is very highly rated and sought after).  Our youngest wanted to apply to Colonel By ",Ottawa

"To provide an argument though, there are benefits to Metrolinx taking over. The big one being that it'll force the Government of Ontario to take a more ""Ontario centric"" approach to public transit instead of just the Toronto centric one that exists today, with all the other cities being left to their own devices.

If uploading the Ottawa LRT to Metrolinx ends up with the Province working to expand regional transportation throughout the entire province in every region, then that is unquestionably a good thing. 

If you really think about it the Confederation Line really fits more of a regional transportation model anyways just due to the distances it has to cover just to connect Kanata to Downtown to Orleans to Barhaven and everything inbetween. When realistically each of those areas on their own would be deserving of better transportation, but all the money gets sucked out of the room just connecting them all together.",Ottawa

"VWBytek was the worst experience I've ever had at a car dealership.I am a woman, late 40's. I went to Bytek looking for a used car. Found one I liked. Then started my journey of hell.
I was sold an anti-rest module. Which I wasn't aware of until I went home to read the paperwork. They speak so fast, write up numbers and combinations. Bamboozled. I really should have read everything thoroughly, right there.
 The day I picked up the car I took it home and my partner looked under the hood for the anti-rust module . It wasn't installed. I phoned the dealership and I was told I could come back in a few days. I was told there was a communication break down. He wasn't told what to do and then it wasn't installed. I was quite frustrated that, had we not looked under the hood,  it's what was paid for. I demanded I get a refund. They hadn't even installed the anti-rust module. They outright refused. They told me they would give me a detailed cleaning package for my troubles. I was not interested in a detailing package. The car was clean, just received my car 4 days ago. I brought my car back to the dealership. When I later picked it up I had asked what was included in the detailing. I was told that it is run by a second party and they had no idea. Frustrated. I just wanted to leave. They had lost my keys. 
I decided that I wanted to cancel my extended warranty. I was within the time frame. I went back to the dealership. I was told that they couldn't refund the money, that the money had been rolled into my loan . I paid off my loan immediately. 2 months later I contacted the bank to see if my funds had been put into my account. The bank said my account was closed. I contacted the bytek again. They told me they will write me a check. This has been ongoing since October. Maybe they treat men differently. Good luck!",Ottawa

"I think you?ll find it?s more about the salesperson and less about the dealership.  All dealerships will have some form of bs ?equality is our motto? slogan, but it?s not true?they, and their sales people, are there to get every dollar they can out of you.  And women seem to be easier targets.

IMO, bring a car knowledgeable guy friend and spend the day going dealership to dealership, and discuss the sales people and guide your search that way (along with the cars obviously)! 

Remember, you have the money and they want that more than you want a car.  You can walk out of the dealership at any time, they?re stuck there.  They?re pressured or incentivized to tack on as many addons as they can, you don?t have to accept or pay for them.

You can, and should, walk away if a deal starts to feel scuzzy, it?s amazing how dealerships can suddenly have a one day promotion a day or two after walking out that just so happen to meet your exact, or near exact, ask.

Obviously some comedians are better than others and everyone has different tastes in humour.  The more refined shows are on the weekend and the beginners/test jokes are at open mic on Monday.  If it's your first time then it's worth the $10 extra to see a weekend show.

Most comedy shows can be quite vulgar, so if you're squeamish you should call and ask about when the ""clean shows"" are scheduled.

If you sit near the front then the comedians might chat and tease you as part of the show.  Personally I love thay, but if  you don't want to be mocked in a room full of people, then sit in the back.

"It's tough for mental health support, I have no doubt that what you're going through is extremely difficult and asking for help likely wasn't easy. 

Lots of resources provided, but I didn't see https://www.counsellingconnect.org/ yet. You can book a counselling session, usually within the next 2 days, and they can help you start to make sense of things or provide immediate talk therapy help. 

As for your questions, I know many people who've gone to the ED for mental health and it's been... not good. Queensway Carleton seems to have been where they've had the better experiences. If they aren't convinced that you're an immediate danger to yourself or others, the doc will send you home with some reading materials (and a list of links that is barely legible and more than half are sites that don't exist anymore.... Seriously, it was not good at all). My intent is definitely not to discourage you from going to the ED, it is a must if you feel unsafe. Just be ready to fight for yourself and to get help. If spending time at the ED waiting to be seen is what's needed to get through the immediate rush of terribleness, then that's awesome on its own, even if it's just to be seen and sent home after. At the very least, they can point you in some helpful directions.

The people I know who've gone and were kept in the psych ward said it was ok. It's scary of course and you're surrounded by other people who are also struggling, but there are always nurses around and I'm told they were fairly responsive and compassionate. Lots of activities and therapy sessions to help pass the time and get you to a place of.more confidence + a social worker to help connect you to the proper resources once you're an outpatient.

"Old Ottawa South, Old Ottawa East and the Glebe are all great neighbourhoods, all within walking distance of downtown (although parts of Old Ottawa East and Old Ottawa South are maybe on the far end of ""walking distance."" Note that transit (buses in the case of those neighbourhoods) is not super reliable. Buses will be every 15 minutes or so during rush hour, but the schedule is only a vague suggestion. 3500-4000 will probably get you a 3-bedroom in one of those neighbourhoods. 

If your kid is not turning 4 in 2025, he will need to go to daycare instead of kindergarten. You have to sign him up on the centralized Child Care Registry and Waitlist , where you can also search for specific programs, like places that offer bilingual daycare: [City of Ottawa Child Care Registry and Waitlist | Child Care Waitlist](https://onehsn.com/Ottawa/ux_2_0). Note that even though it calls itself a ""waitlist,"" daycares generally won't reach out to people on the waitlist. You have to register your kid on the waitlist AND then call the daycare(s) you're interested in directly. There are also some private daycares that do not use the centralized website and don't receive any government money, so are more expensive  - For example, Riverside Montessori in Old Ottawa East, which is also bilingual. Daycares on the centralized waitlist are partially government-funded, but there are additional subsidies for low-income people (which you presumably won't be eligible for).

I wouldn't worry about ""school districts"" or school rankings. People who obsess over those do so mostly because they have watched too much US TV. The quality of schools in Ottawa is pretty consistent unless you're in a really rough neighbourhood - Old Ottawa South, Old Ottawa East and the Glebe all have good schools. In the OCDSB (english secular school board), kindergarten is always 50% French, 50% English and lasts for two years. You then start Grade 1, which is 80% French if you sign up for French Immersion (although there is talk of reducing this to 60%). Contrary to what some might recommend, I'd actually recommend signing your kid up in the OCDSB immersion program. If your kid already speaks French, it will be enough for him to maintain his level of French, while also providing enough exposure to English for your kid to learn it. Since it's the biggest board, you are more likely to find a school near your house with kids who live nearby. One advantage of Lycee Claudel though would be that since they are mainly a school for expats, their instructional years and curriculum will be more neatly lined up with European curricula, possibly making it easier when (if!) you move home or to a new posting.",Ottawa

"Right, so people are pointing out that Obama and Biden have deported people, which is certainly a fair point to mention.  However, I do not recall either of those presidents creating so much fear and hate surrounding immigrants, falsely labeling so many as criminals, there is a difference in rhetoric, and that's important to keep in mind.  This orange baboon actively terrorizes the undocumented population by dehumanizing them, which is fucking dangerous.  It allows masses of people who need to feel superior to others in order to maintain their own self worth, to feel justified in doing the same.  This also impacts legal immigrants because the less enlightened masses deem anyone who looks and sounds different than them, as illegals.

"I definitely understand the belief that Wu could do more to push housing developments within the city. To that I say, the progress that had happened while slow is major. 

Mayor Wu?s campaign ran on the fact that we as a city have been in a chokehold from the power that the BPDA had. They were a quasi governmental position that both owned land (which they used to lease out and then pay themselves) in the city but also decided which developers got projects and where they could be built. Up until the last 10 years I think they still had the power to take over land due to urban renewal policies that effectively led the destruction of the west end. 

It?s only been a few months since Mayor Wu was able to overhaul the entity and force them to be a city department so that their work would be over the purview and review of the city. This means that unlike in the past they can hold the department accountable for both the amount and kind of development that they are allowing. 

Other major strides include the ADU guide book that offers ADU typologies with floor plans and tools for residents to explore adding missing middle housing as well as the office to housing conversion grants that she is trying to leverage to create more housing in downtown.

All this to say, growth is slow, especially when the city was built using backwards policies and groups that actively destroyed the city for their own and for their friend?s (developers keen on creating more value by adding offices and commercial without housing) benefit.

I also agree that if Kraft is so keen to add more housing, someone with his kind of money is exactly the kind of partner that the city could use. Most of the time developments don?t happen because adaptive reuse of office to residential costs so much. Why hasn?t he stepped up to add additional funds to help create the kind of housing he advocates for?",Boston

"My advice, which applies especially if you move here without a car (which I recommend), is to live on the side of the river that you work on.  It will generally simplify your commute.  If you take buses (47, 70) across the river into C'port from Brighton or Allston, you have to deal with bridges where there are often traffic tie-ups.  

Next, look at Google maps and find your employer.  Then start looking for bus and T (subway) routes that will get you close to there, and then look at the MBTA website for the route (especially buses) to see what will be a \*reliable\* commute.  Some buses run with a lot more frequency than others.  Some commutes might require both T and bus, or two buses.  The more legs of a commute you have, the less reliable it becomes as there's little to no coordination between the two modes of transport as far as schedule is concerned.

This can help you figure out where to live.   If I were you, I'd probably look in North Cambridge and bus or walk to Porter Square and walk to work from Central Square, using the Red Line.  Or Somerville, with a connecting bus to  Davis Square for the Red Line.  The further out you get from transit, whether bus or T, the less expensive it should be.  You could look in Arlington, just beyond the Cambridge line, and take a bus to Alewife (poor service though) or to Porter (better service, more traffic).",Boston

Six juveniles, one as young as 12, and an 18-year-old have been charged in last month?s assault of a 13-year-old boy at the Forest Hills MBTA station, the Suffolk district attorney?s office said Thursday.

The boy was hospitalized and treated for multiple cuts on his forehead and bruising on his body, prosecutors said in a statement.

Lucas Goncalves-Depina, 18, and the six juveniles were detained when they returned to the Forest Hills station, prosecutors said.

The boy told police a girl instigated the Jan. 14 attack when she sat next to him on a bus heading to Forest Hills and said she wanted to fight because he was ?spreading rumors? about her, prosecutors said.

The boy said the girl followed him off the bus and punched him in the face multiple times. He got away, but another boy put his arm around his shoulder and walked him toward the bike path, where a group of kids jumped him, punching and kicking him to the ground, authorities said.

Two adults broke up the assault, with one using his bike to separate the attackers. All but one ran away. The juvenile who remained ?would not stop kicking the victim,? prosecutors said.

Surveillance video showed eight to 10 juveniles striking the boy, prosecutors said.

Investigators pulled still images from the video and used them to identify the alleged attackers.

Goncalves-Depina has been charged with assault and battery and assault and battery with a deadly weapon (his foot), prosecutors said. At a hearing on Jan. 15 in Boston Municipal Court in West Roxbury, he was released on personal recognizance. His next court date is Feb. 21.

Five teenagers, ages 14 to 16, face the same charges in Dorchester Juvenile Court. They have been arraigned and are scheduled to return to court March 14, prosecutors said.

A 12-year-old has also been charged but has not been arraigned, prosecutors said.

?I thank the Transit police for their quick work in identifying the juveniles involved in this frightening assault, and I?m grateful for the witnesses who assisted this young victim,? District Attorney Kevin Hayden said. ?It?s easy for any caring person to imagine the fear this boy must have felt during such a vicious attack.?",Boston

"Didn't the bike lanes take a lot of parking away from businesses? (Genuinely asking so don't downvote me for not knowing). 

The only issue I have with bike lanes is on streets that are already insanely narrow and when people don't use them correctly. If there's a bike lane, ride single file. So many times I see cyclists riding side by side and it's very hard to get around them.

Since that's been changed in ways we didn't predict, why wouldn't more and more White people start to look for their own groups to their own benefit? I've been worried about this for years because the steps to legitimize these concerns at some level have been happening for a while.

"When the Nutshells went on exhibit at the Smithsonian in 2017-18, Harvard and MFA decided, without consulting with the Smithsonian or anybody at the Maryland OCME where they are housed, that the dioramas would be taken up to Boston and put on exhibit.

Ill-advisedly, MFA put a Nutshell exhibition on the museum's public calendar, unveiled a website, etc. before all the details had been worked out.

The Smithsonian exhibit took 18 months of planning and work. I was involved and observed every step along the way. The Smithsonian hired a company and spent a ridiculous amount of money to fabricate custom boxes for the move. There was a whole team of Smithsonian people whose expertise is moving art. We rehearsed and practiced every step of the move; lifting the boxes, measuring doorways and figuring out the best path to move through the building, etc. They were transported in a special truck with a suspension designed for moving art, six at a time in one layer (no stacking), at the midpoint between the truck axles to minimize jostling. The dioramas were transported in three batches, driven very carefully 35 miles from Baltimore to Washington, and re-examined by the conservation team to make sure nothing was damaged before they were placed into custom-made cabinets and display cases for the exhibition.

MFA had a team of three people. They claimed they could do in six weeks what took 18 months for Smithsonian. MFA basically wanted to put the Nutshells in a truck and drive them to Boston.

The whole idea was sketchy. It was rushed, an unreasonable timetable, not enough people or resources. Driving down the street from Baltimore to Washington is very different than taking them 400 miles to Boston.

The Smithsonian people told me that the Nutshells would be damaged being taken to Boston. There are parts held together by 80-year-old string, glass and acrylic windowpanes held in place with miniscule wooden wedges. Numerous pieces and components that are extremely delicate and now very old. The movement and vibration would unavoidably do things, perhaps cause irreparable damage. The Smithsonian just spent more than $250,000 for the Nutshell conservation, and at this point are good for generations to come. But if they go to Boston they will be damaged. One of the Smithsonian staffers told me, ""Please don't let that happen.""

An exhibit at MFA would have made the dioramas unavailable for a homicide seminar, which is the reason why the Nutshells exist. Many of us suspected they may never return to Baltimore for teaching in the homicide seminar. Somebody in Boston suggested that perhaps photographs would be good enough for the honicide seminar. I suggested they exhibit the photographs.

"My attempt at simplifying this:
Every grant budget has the same categories. Personnel costs which is to fund the staff for the project. Direct Costs which is specific items related to a project, for example, purchasing specific equipment. Subcontractor costs if you?re partnering with another organization or entity. And then there is indirect costs which represent expenses associated with general operations. Like paying the rent to keep the lights on for a lab. Or supporting the payroll administrator who ensures the personnel gets paid. Indirect costs are the backbone of an organization?s operations. Also known as overhead or administrative costs

"The only high quality BBQ spots are BT's Smokehouse and The Rusty Can, each is 60-90 minutes drive from the city. 

If you don't want to leave the area, the Smoke Shop scratches the itch. Their pork belly burnt ends are always tip-top, though a lot of their menu is hit or miss. I also think their sauces run a little sweet - so use it sparingly. They have a great whiskey bar. If you go to the one in Kendall, you can hit up State Park after which is a great neighborhood bar. 

Sweet Cheeks is Tiffany Faison's (Top Chef Winner) anchor restaurant. I think it's on the same level as Smoke Shop - though, it's been fairly inconsistent lately (and I think Faison has kinda lost the plot with some of her other concepts too - though, I love her as a contestant). 

Redbones is a fun bar, but the food just isn't good (sides can be fine). I've always find Blue Ribbon to be a pile of slop, so I'd avoid that. 

Keep your eyes open for Wade BBQ. Not currently operating, my understanding is he's looking for a brick & mortar location at the moment - and it's about as good as anything in the heart of Texas.",Boston

"I like the Western Greenway trails. From Alewife, you take the Fitchburg Cutoff to its end, cross Brighton St, right on Hittinger, run past Clay Pit Pond and the high school and then up Concord to Belmont Town Center, that will put you nearby. From there just go up the giant hill via Concord or Somerset, or turn left on Pleasant St and go up Snake Hill Rd to the connecting trail or up the gravel fire road further down. This is a great network of trails that connects many parks and reserves in Belmont, Waltham and Lexington. It has meadows, ponds, forests, estates, an old cemetery and cool abandoned buildings like the Metropolitan State School and the Fernald Center. Just look out for and give right-of-way to bikes (they should also let you know they are coming) and, in Beaver Brook Reservation, please stay off the winding switchbacked jump trail coming down from the water tower on Mackerel Hill that is ONLY meant for descending bikes. If you want to do some cross-training Cornelia Warren is a great workout park. If you want a brew stop Mighty Squirrel is great, and I think they even have a run group that meets there.  


If you want to shorten the amount of running or spend more of it in the trails, you can take the 73 bus from Harvard Sq, which is a good bus that runs frequently, or the commuter rail from Porter drop you at Waverley station in Belmont. In fact, if you start at Waverley, you could also take Waverley Oaks Rd and the MA Central Rail Trail (or just the trail if they ever finish the Linden St. bridge) to the Prospect Hill trails and back and still stay within 10 mi.

Also the Minuteman has some cool jumping-off points. Work your way through the neighborhood south of Spy Pond to the trail on its southwest side (or across the pond if it's frozen like it was last week), then up to the trails in Metonymy Rocks Park, and further up to Robbins Hill and the Park Circle water tower.  
Go around Arlington Reservoir then up Mt Gilboa, across to McClennen Park and Whipple Hill then through Great Meadows back to the trail.

I like the Fells a lot for running too - both the west side and the east side.

I'd also recommend getting a bike and using that to get to places to run as a much more flexible and often faster mode of transport. You don't need to spend much money on the bike if you're just getting from a to b. Anything with skinny tires that fits you. You can hide it in the forest and lock it to a tree if you can't find other options. It's great cross-training and the fact that you cover more ground more quickly means you have a lot of freedom to explore and discover even more places to run.

Lastly, turn on the biking layer on Google maps - any of the paved or unpaved trails it marks are going to be great places to run and some of the recommended roads might be fine as well.",Boston

Boston?s human population grew about 9 percent between 2011 and 2020, according to US census data, a bigger increase than the prior decade. Since scientists started keeping records around the turn of the 20th century, the city?s temperature has risen by more than 3 degrees Fahrenheit, givingÿ[rats](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/04/10/metro/boston-city-council-pest-control-rats/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)ÿmore days each year to forage, have offspring, and become unwelcome andÿ[potentially dangerous](https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-pets/rodent-control/index.html)ÿhouseguests, Richardson said.

?People can get sick; there?s a public health component there,? Richardson said. ?There are also mental health burdens that come from proximity to rats.?

There are far more rats in urban than rural areas, the study said, because the animals rely on human resources. Rat activity is also dependent on temperature, researchers said.

?Warming temperatures resulting from climate change or urban heat islands may extend the seasonal window for aboveground foraging and active breeding period for rats, supporting population growth,? researchers wrote.

TLDR
Boston colleges have hundreds of Boston-specific scholarships between them. If your kid is in the top 10% of their class, they have a very high chance of getting full tuition or higher scholarships to the local colleges. 

There are three exam schools for middle/high schools all which are in the top 20 for the state. My kids went to exam schools for middle school. 

For high school, they all went to Boston Arts Academy (located right across the street from Fenway Park). Although  BAA isn?t nearly as academically rigorous as the exam school it has as high a college participation. Few AP classes, but tons of dual enrollment opportunities with local colleges. Additionally, students are very attractive to most colleges because they are very ?spiky? i.e. excelling in a specific non-academic field. 

One of my kids ended up with a full tuition scholarship to BU, another with a full tuition scholarship to Berklee, and the third with an everything scholarship to Northeastern. This savings has more than offset the high costs of living in the city. (Our income is 60% of yours, but we bought our home 15 years ago, so we can?t really do an apples to apples comparison.)

When our children were little, my husband and I seriously considered moving to the burbs for ?better? schools, but we were concerned about the lack of racial and economic diversity. Brookline would have been ok, but it was much too expensive for us. Additionally we wanted alternative education for our kids. Boston was the right fit for our kids. 

Over the years our kids attended a series on non-traditional education schools: a two-way bilingual school, a music-based charter school, exam schools, and an arts school. We were able to supplement their education with extra-curriculars, both free and paid. 

They?re still in college so I can?t tell you that our plan led to success, but they do agree that this worked for them.",Boston

* fondue is only cheese and bread. No dipping anything else than bread (unless you want to be cursed for 10 generations).
* Dry white wine with the fondue is advised for a good experience.
* Don't let the cheese mellow. There must at all time be someone stirring the caquelon. It's the rule.
* A tradition says also to take a small glass of kirsch in the middle of the meal, as the ""coup du milieu"".
* You can eat the cheese with pickles. It goes well with the cheese. Some would also add charcuterie, but that's a blasphemy.

To be honest, the best you will get will likely be across the border in France, but make sure you look for an ""Artisan Boulanger"", as this means almost everything is made on site.

You can find some of these in Geneva too (just use Google).

One of the best light and fluffy croissants I have had recently was in Le Sentier (bakery is called La Ronde des Pains, but was sold in the Denner which is currently under renovation). But if you do not have personal transportation, it's hard to get there.

The best small/dense croissant I have had was at Bonin in Nyon. But it is only a storefront, no seating available.

Otherwise, be aware that at storefront only bakeries, and even at so called ""boutiques"", you will likely be getting something that was made in a factory and only baked on premise, or made in a central location and delivered to the boutique.

A few weeks ago, /u/EntertainmentJust431 had the idea to create an iceberg chart for Switzerland. I (/u/musiu) had this idea as well in the past, although lacking in motivation and technical ability to create the effective image. Together we dug in the www for many evenings, asked friends about old stories and urban legends, and after many hour, reworks and new versions, here?s the final result. Some things were really difficult to translate as they are swissgerman terms for something very specific? Sometimes you just have to google and dig yourself to find the story behind it?

In case you have any questions about the pictures or the terms we put on the chart, ask us. We deliver background information as well as sources for everything! Furthermore, there are 3 small easter eggs hidden in the chart. Who can find them?

How can you create a story for what it means to you and how it aligns with what you want and the woman you want to be?

Moving represents a big energy/time/money investment and requires you do be ready to stretch, to expand your worldview and mindset, to welcome/develop a new part of you and let go of an older one. It's an amazing experience and can be extraordinarily rewarding and beautiful when embraced fully.

If you start working and send the kids to a kindergarten this costs a lot. The waiting list for public kindergartens is huge and you won?t get a place immediately (in fact you have to wait year(s)). If you send both of them (since under 4yo) this is going to be 5-6K per month in total in a private one and 4-5 for public if EXTREMELY lucky.

"Everywhere in Switzerland you?ll get directions to the next village, to the train station. It?s purpose designed for what you?re looking for, discovering Switzerland on foot.

You can?t got wrong if you stick to the yellow arrows and yellow losanges, which is the sign that you?re on a pedestrian tourism (tourisme p‚destre) footpath laid down by the Swiss government. Bring those footpaths in your pocket with the Swisstopo app.

Wanna escape Geneva by car? Mont Mourex in neighboring France is a lovely spot, with plenty of pathways across the hill, with fantastic views of the countryside and the lake. It peaks at 800m, roughly 400m above the lake, and is thus rarely covered in snow. It?s mostly covered in trees, with a beautiful clearing on the summit. No yellow arrows there as you?re in France, but the paths are well marked nonetheless.

Stick to Switzerland by train? Stop in any of the stations between Bellevue and Versoix, and follow the yellow arrows of Swiss rando, to get for instance to Collex and back. Or just wander in the Versoix woods, which is the largest forest in Geneva canton. In this case, aim for Sauverny by staying in the woods, then back.

All of the above options are literally 20mins from Geneva, so you?d be optimizing for the outdoor time.

If you wanna go further, and hit a Unesco world heritage countryside spot, then a good long walk in Lavaux (past Lausanne) is definitely what you?re looking for. Most convenient is to get by train to Lutry, and walk up into the vineyards and then down to Saint-Saphorin. Once there, train back. Again here, follow the yellow arrows.",Geneva

"When I lived in Geneva a few years ago, I had the following (pardon from any memory-related errors):

* SBB - Superior to TPG for purchasing tickets. Used it for TPG tickets and routed tickets for trains/cable cars/etc. It works on so much of the transport routes you need, including some you would not think. For the 4 years we lived there, we skipped the car and either walked, took the tram/bus, or trains for longer travel. You really can live comfortably without a car and save yourself a bunch of expense. Get half-fare cards for the adults and junior cards for your children under 15. They all integrate with the app and pay for themselves with one weekend train trip.
* Migros - I lived within 10 minutes of the Balexert Migros and a smaller Migros, so that was my loyalty card of choice. Reasonable cash back vouchers. You may also want to look at the grocery delivery service which is really affordable and will save you a bunch of time. Even at the full monthly rate, getting at least 1 delivery a week for your family means you are spending less than 4CHF on delivery each week.
* TPG - Still useful from time to time for seeing disruptions and some local information.
* Google Maps - Getting around within the city. Walking directions to the tram or bus stop, a detailed routing with transfers, plan trips ahead, and live routing around disruptions.
* TWINT - Quick and simple payments tied directly to your bank account. Works on just about any card reader terminal. Integrates with your Swiss bank account and your other apps like SBB and Migros.
* AlertSwiss - Know about emergencies. Although I never used it much. Had to peel myself off the ceiling every February though.
* Accuweather - pretty accurate predictions for when you will need to pull out the umbrella or raincoat down to the minute.
* Google Translate - Point the camera at text and see what it says. I have spent years on French, but I will probably never even get to B2 level (as opposed to my wife and kids who are fluent).
* WhatsApp - Coming from the USA, we had not used WhatsApp a lot, but it is what we use almost exclusively now, and is especially useful for weekly calls with family back in the states who might be on the other mobile ecosystem.
* Pathe - Useful for the movie theater in Balexert.
* SBB Freesurf - free wifi on some trains
* bank account and access apps
* Swiss ID - single sign on identification of you.
* SwitzerlandMobility - Detailed hiking trails
* Airalo - for eSIM when traveling across border or on break
* White Risk - avalanche app for when you are in the mountains

There are also a few websites that I found to be important that might not have apps (or you might not regularly use the app).

* [ge.ch](http://ge.ch) Get registered on this with the added validation ASAP. The e-demarches let you manage your arrival requirements, departure requirements, annual tax submissions, kids' after-school activity registration, bulky waste pickup, and a whole lot more.

"Have you applied already/ contacted the bureau de logements of the university you are studying in? 
As soon as you are a student more options are available for you at the university if you apply early enough, they will try their best to allocate students in some universities building for a pretty fair price if there is still enough space. If you haven't it will be pretty hard to find a logement given that you probably don't have a 3x paycheck of the rent. But for sure maybe in some Facebook group / other platforms you may find some deal that are not very cheap but better than nothing.

The best option you have on a low budget is to call the bureau de logements and ask if they have a place. Definitely call, as they don't answer emails quite fast enough ( at least for the unige). Better if you go there yourself but I'm assuming you are still in UK",Geneva

There is another option that the expats would do: suitcase delivery. We would leverage our network for people who were travelling to the country that had the thing, ship it to them, and have them bring it back.

Failing that, ship to a relative and pay for a prepaid shipping label that they can take into a storefront for the shipping company (UPS/Fedex/DHL) and have them ship to you.

"I was recently told by the chef in a D”ner restaurant (not sure where he was from, by the accent I'd have said the Balkans rather than Turkey) that in most of Europe, anyone can go anywhere without problems, except on Halloween, New Year's eve and during the Carnival, because people drop all their inhibitions on those days. Based on things that happened during the past decade or so, I tend to agree and stay home on these days.

"Globally thousands of worker from UN and NGO are as we speak, fired. Mostly for the time being where programs founded by the US are running. Some of the people I know just yesterday. At Geneva level it will follow the renewal of the contract. The most impacted is WHO as they already had cash flow issue end of 2024 and some contracts were already not renewed in December. The next wave will be in March. As already said by others how many and who will be impacted is difficult to know as those organizations are not communicating clearly as they still trying to find solutions. It's clear it will have an impact on the international Geneva but how much it is hard to say. 
Now to answer to those who think the impact will be minor on Geneva I would like to remind people that event most of international staff are not paying taxes most of the staff is local! From cleaners to administrative staff. Also even some of the international staff is not paying some of the taxes ( some taxes are still due depending of your level ) and some but not all living in France, this staff is spending a lot in Geneva so supporting local businesses and paying VAT. Also usually the staff with Family will put there children in one of the international schools in Geneva ( even if living in France). I will not go into detail but a last point in regard of economical impact on Geneva, is that those organisations are used to run training, meetings and workshops with consultants generating cash flow for Geneva like hotels, restaurants, souvenirs, bars?
But I don?t think it will change the actual trend of job decrease in Switzerland ( the watch industry is reducing staff), lets hope I'm wrong",Geneva

Plenty of places in Pays de Gex where you?ll have 100% chance success rate of leaving your car parked there? :?). Look around some of the private parkings of chemin de la planche br–l‚e or Route de Meyrin in Ferney. You won?t be the only one without license plates there.,Geneva
"Welcome in advance! 

I?m not sure what you mean by 30% - the typical rule is that your monthly salary must be 3x more than the monthly rent (gross salary - although I?ve seen some palaces ask for net). 

Anecdotally, you can be rejected from an apartment for earning too much relative to the rent price. R‚gies (property management companies - usually the ones who rent out apartments) and landlords sometimes tend to favorise specific profiles based on various factors including income. Some r‚gies might not rent you a multi bedroom apartment if you are the sole occupier, for example.

The rental market in Geneva is very difficult at the best of times. It is purely a game of numbers and speed, and in some cases knowing people in the right place - apply to as many places that tick your boxes as possible as quickly as possible (be quick to react to new listings). 

You can have a look on Homegate, Immoscout24, Comparis and Anibis. I would also recommend joining the various housing groups on Facebook, and checking the classified ads on Glocals. Lease takeovers can sometimes yield better results than going directly to a r‚gie. 

Important tips: housing scams are increasingly common. Never pay a ®ÿdepositÿ¯ to visit an apartment. Landlords / r‚gies will never chase you because demand is too high, so if they?re pestering you, chances are something is wrong.

Also: be prepared to face ®ÿrelocation agentsÿ¯ - they are basically intermediaries who often advertise properties directly but charge a commission if you are allocated the property (1-1.5 months rent is typical). In some cases, despite the cost, these agents can have their merits - they can leverage their experience and network to get your application for the Appartment pushed through. They also can go on viewings on your behalf if you?re pressed for time and can help with a lot of the admin. While I definitely recommend an independent search, many people do end up relying on these agents. 

Be prepared for the harsh reality that you may need to rely on short term accommodation options for your first few months here. You need time to build the strongest application file (®ÿdossierÿ¯) which often requires 3 payslips. Some will accept a work contract in lieu - but remember, competition is fierce so the best dossiers will always win. 


I hope this helps!",Geneva

"First of all, you can?t choose your public school directly. What I mean is that you will be assigned to the public school of your commune. 

To ?choose? a public school, you can select where to move however and then get the right to access the public school. I hope you see my point here.

For example, we picked a very specific commune and moved there so that our kids have access to the specific public school after speaking with many people and friends. That being said, all public schools are great but communes may differ e.g Paquis vs Eaux Vives",Geneva

"That would be great measure to facilitate even greater traffic jams. Not enoiugh of already created artificial traffic jams?

Most mid size cities in europe, 2-3m have no issue with jams as they solve them, rather creating them. All efforts are made to keep the traffic flow, and it does flow. Keep the 'green' waves, rather then introduce 'red' waves like commies do in Geneva.

Congestions are made artificially here by pushing red lights with no other reason but to annoy, closing lanes and blocking perfectly sensible turns that were present for ages (another exteme is to allow insensible turns where they should not be allowed - again, in order to congest even more).

Take for an example Route de Ferney next to Intercontinental. Perfectly viable two lane road is reduced to one, the other one turned into a bus lane - for a single bus that goes every 15 min. Justification - new 'Grand Saconnex' tunnel opened. True, the new useless tunnel opened that costed hundreds of millions that will benefit few frontaliers living in Gex and working in WHO. Not even others working in other organizations - they don't use the tunnel.

To pass the stretch from Sismondi to the broken chair at 09am - takes 30 min (yes, 30 minutes for 500m) on the road 'designed to alleviate the traffic with the newly opened tunnel). The congestion that was never there before the Ferney lane was closed.

Funny there is never a congestion in the tunnel - since no one uses it anyway. Even in order to get to it you need to pass through small streets interrupted by unnecessary traffic lights. Millions vasted but Geneva tax payers seem to be happy about it - so be it. Same goes for useless Grand Saconnex junction - another project that took 10 years to develop for no reason at all (other than to keep labor busy and keep social peace).

But tunnel or the bridge to cross the lake - a big no.

Crossing Rue de la Servette / Bd James-Fazy

Cycling east-ward on Rue de la Servette as you pass under the train tracks you have to be in the middle of the road. Motorbikes and scooters use the bike lane to skip traffic and don't care if they run you over.

"They have little to do with Geneva or Switzerland bar being present here. They are under a different tax status, under different insurances, their kids often go to private schools, they are under different civil and employment rights & obligations under UN law etc. Overall they live within a social and cultural bubble too - mostly just meeting up with others in the UN/IO world. Those who choose not to, need almost never speak to or make friends with a local, let alone learn French. There are plenty who've been here 20+ years and can barely order a coffee, including in my own village. I worked for one of these organisations for a time, and I would say Swiss citizens made up only 5-10% of the staff in my particular large org (not the case for all though, I'm sure). It's like a completely parallel society.

On the negative side, locals often believe that the large number of UN / IO staff with tax free salaries help to push up house prices (the only people I know who bought a house in the last 10 years and UN/IO types), are naturally additional competition for housing, push up insurance costs, and push up taxes which UN/IO types don't pay but whose services the taxes pay for they still use. 

Here's also a personal view, having grown up both as a local and in this world (which other Swiss likely won't have) from what I observed the profile of the average UN / IO staffer has been changing in the last 30 years, and unfortunately not for the better. Those hired in the 70s-90s tended to be chosen largely based on their skillset, but with their retirement the UN / IOs seem to be becoming much more nepotistic as well as more elitist. If you don't have some kind of connections in the organisations, or have a government supporting you, it's incredibly hard to get through the door. With the rarity of stable, long term contracts in Geneva (and the proliferation of unpaid internships, which some IOs seen to almost run on) this weeds out the ""poors"".",Geneva

"I went to Swiss public school until my teenage years, then I transitioned to private schools. I studied at Florimont/Petit-Lancy before moving on to the International Baccalaureate (MES). My experience with the French system at Florimont was quite negative?it was heavily academic with little emphasis on critical thinking. Additionally, there was a strong culture of materialism among the students, with many teens flaunting luxury brands like Dior and Louis Vuitton.

While I?ve heard similar things about other schools like the cole Internationale, I found the International Baccalaureate more engaging, as it encouraged critical thinking?though this might have been specific to the school I attended. Ultimately, the best choice depends on your child's happiness and their needs. One consideration for those aiming to study in an English-speaking country is that completing a bilingual International Baccalaureate can exempt them from having to take the TOEFL to qualify for university admission.",Geneva

My recommendations are Bain des Paquis or Cafe du Soleil. Yes one can argue that they're not the best or what not but these are Geneva institutions and I think it's best to check them out for yourself.

"The fumes are getting better at least - air quality is improving every year. Which I guess makes sense with fully/hybrid electric cars and motorcycles gradually taking over. What is left is the big traffic jams. Higher taxes on cars, stimulate bicycles and motorcycles, expand public transport, it's all happening but it could be faster. But you need the money, and the votes to make it move faster.

Moving the major cross-town arteries underground would be a start though - convert Quai Gustav-Ador, Pont Mont Blanc, Quai Mont Blanc & Wilson to tunnels, plus Rue de Chantepoulet, Rue de Lausanne, Av Pictet, and Route de Malagnou and you'll have moved most of the permanent commuter traffic jam in the centre out of sight and taken out all those intersections/traffic lights.

Of course I asked if that was legal and they told me ?it?s apparently not illegal?. That infuriated me so I asked them to solve it or I would change provider. Three days later their tech support sent me an email that they had fixed it and since then I am receiving maybe just one of these fake calls every two weeks, which I guess it?s better than three to five times per day?

"In Geneva, all the jams are artificially created. i've been to number of big size cities in europe, 2-3m no issue with jams. Yes, there are frequent but effort is made to keep the traffic flow, and it does flow. Keep the 'green' waves, rather then introduce 'red' waves like commies do in Geneva.

Congestions are made artificially here by pushing red lights with no other reason but to annoy, closing lanes and blocking perfectly sensible turns that were present for ages (another exteme is to allow insensible turns where they should not be allowed - again, in order to congest even more).

Take for an example Route de Ferney next to Intercontinental. Perfectly viable two lane road is reduced to one, the other one turned into a bus lane - for a single bus that goes every 15 min. Justification - new 'Grand Saconnex' tunnel opened. True, the new useless tunnel opened that costed hundreds of millions that will benefit few frontaliers living in Gex and working in WHO. Not even others working in other organizations - they don't use the tunnel.

To pass the stretch from Sismondi to the broken chair at 09am - takes 30 min (yes, 30 minutes for 500m) on the road 'designed to alleviate the traffic with the newly opened tunnel). The congestion that was never there before the Ferney lane was closed.

Funny there is never a congestion in the tunnel - since no one uses it anyway. Even in order to get to it you need to pass through small streets interrupted by unnecessary traffic lights. Millions vasted but Geneva tax payers seem to be happy about it - so be it. Same goes for useless Grand Saconnex junction - another project that took 10 years to develop for no reason at all (other than to keep labor busy and keep social peace).

But tunnel or the bridge to cross the lake - a big no.",Geneva
"100% agree with the OP?thanks for sharing your thoughts! I was starting to think there was something wrong with me for noticing these things.

I?d also add (as someone mentioned below) the pervasive cigarette smoke and people throwing butts on the ground. Based on my observations, this seems to be more of a cultural issue than a class one. Another thing that bothers me is how some people don?t give way when exiting a plane to those seated ahead of them. I once called out some asshole in English for doing exactly this, only to get insulted in French?big mistake on their part, as I speak it fluently and had no hesitation in confronting them.

I won?t even get started on the reckless driving?blocking pedestrian crossings, excessive honking(!), and the general petrolhead mentality. Then there?s the spitting(!) and littering?

It?s a shame because, otherwise, Geneva is a beautiful, multicultural, and inspiring city with so much to offer, not to mention its outsized influence in many areas and the stunning surrounding nature.

"I just went through this. There is no way through (in either direction) without a boarding pass. You can take an uber or taxi from Suisse TO the French sector, and you can depart the French sector with a taxi. Uber pickups are prohibited from the French sector. 

They charge a 50 euro flat fee from GVA French side to Geneva canton. It?s 30-35 euros to travel by taxi from the French to Swiss sides and vice versa.

Also, while you can order an uber to take you from Swiss to French side, none of the drivers will accept the ride. Save your time and take a taxi.

So basically budget in 80-100 chf on top of your rental price when comparing sides. Also note that cars rented from the French side will not include a Swiss highway travel medallion, so if you want to travel on Swiss highways you will have to stop at border control or a Swiss petrol station to purchase one.",Geneva

I once switched to public school and it was a horrible experience. I was used to smaller classes and being followed closely by my teachers. So I would recommend you to chose a school where your kids can learn French and English. Even if the goal is not to stay, they will have an extra language, and that?s always a plus.

"The people listed on this site are mostly people running Airbnb business for owners. You can check, at least the two first have websites.

It?s possible that owners put it on Airbnb but it?s not the biggest group. You can sublease trough Airbnb but you have to check with r‚gie, it?s a motive to stop your contract.

In Geneva you?re allowed to rent your place 90 days per year. If you do more, you have to change the status of your flat to a commercial one, which won?t happen.

If you leave in an area subjected to price protected leases you?re not allowed to rent it on Airbnb.

What I don?t get is this website is runned for a while and in one day you can quickly check who is renting the flat more than 90 days (by checking if there are availabilities 90 days in the future)

The argument from people running this business is that they help owners maximizing rent by offering airbnb opportunities 90 days a year  but they clearly do it more. Also they can take the lease on their name or just say it?s relocation agency and it works.

Also it would be huge work for the state for little money to get back and huge procedures, not even ensuring that the flats are going back in the open market after wise.

Numbers seems high but they won?t solve the crisis we face in any way. For some flats you could get more money in 90 days than having a bad tenant",Geneva

"Christian Jankowski?s work is based on unusual and generally heterogeneous interactions between the art world and people from other cultural or professional fields. He offers collaborations that involve the media, politics, entertainment, religion, or the art market, fields to which he brings a caustic, detached perspective. On the heights of the Plaine de Plainpalais, the questionÿ*Soll ich noch Geld ausgeben?*(Should I spend more money?) is inspired by handwritten notes he addresses to the people surrounding him ? assistants, students, gallerists, etc. ? as well as to himself. These memory aids include all types of reflections, from the most trivial to the most philosophical. The text he has selected in this case substitutes for advertising signs and incitements to consumption by offering an interrogative message on the need to spend money. The artist draws on private ? this emphasized by the use of the personal pronoun ? and pragmatic considerations, to give them a universal and reflexive significance addressed to everyone.

"I'm just an EU immigrant ;) living and working in Geneva. Came here with a car. Immediately, I was put off driving in this traffic chaos. So I walk and use the bike a lot. Car is usually parked in the expensive parking lot. I personally never use public transport as the city is quite small and walkable. A bicycle is even better, if you manage to survive the traffic chaos. A scooter is a good option as well. However, I still need the car and will use it for travel, shopping in France ;) and other activities, let's call it an active lifestyle and exploring this country. I'll even drive to work if it is raining, but only because I don't have to pass the city center and get stuck in traffic. A luxury of modern living. Call me fat and lazy, but I'm none of those...I believe. 

Another thing that I noticed here, public transport is functioning great, however it is expensive. I could drive to Lausanne and it would be way cheaper than using a train. A car is not a luxury, but still a necessity for some people and families. So improving public transport while making it more affordable would obviously be the way. Restrictions and further taxation would only hinder the middle class. All of you Porsche and luxury car drivers obviously wouldn't mind. So I don't think that is the ultimate solution. Just like electric cars. When you think about the minerals used, how they were procured and the waste associated with it, are they really cleaner than internal combustion engines? Which could by the way be improved so much if there was really an interest in doing so (oil lobby)...but it makes you feel good sitting in a Tesla. 

So yeah, things are a bit more complex when you really think about it. We're stuck with the infrastructure not built for so many cars. And if your life consists of just going to work, paying taxes, living in a city and going where the public transport takes you, you really don't need a car. You need Klaus Schwab's 15min city and a government authorization for when you want to leave it. But what do you really ""need"" besides food, water, air and shelter?  Maybe that is just my backwards reasoning, the Swiss and the Davos crowd will probably come up with an ultimate solution sooner or later ;)",Geneva

"Eh, I know a lot of people on here and in Geneva at large appreciate the bit on disdain for them but as a bit of a cross-over audience (Swiss-American (and French but meh) who worked for the UN) - I think it's a bigger impact than expected, or rather has the potential for it. 

The international organisations are a massive part of our local economy. While right now, the US's position is officially a 'pause' - hard to not see there's potential for pretty large cuts and given how massive of a share of funding the US represents, particularly for humanitarian and development agencies that make up a big cornerstone of Geneva-based UN bodies, that's pretty huge. We're talking potential agency-crippling defunding that can't be made up by other countries or other funding sources easily. 

And that does mean (apart from the operational impact that'll have actually intervening in those crises) - likely pretty drastic shifts that may hit Geneva quite hard. Not suggesting Geneva will go impoverished in a year obviously. But many of those international organisations have already been under immense pressure to both reduce costs and downsize headcount in non-operational offices like Geneva. 

Right now - I expect most of the agencies in Geneva are likely on hold waiting to see what the other shoe drop looks like and preparing for what that may be. That means at minimum, likely holding on extending contracts, freezing new hires, etc. Which is brutal for friends working in the system. If cuts are announced, it'll likely soon be people out of jobs - not just international staff obviously but also local staff hired in, which is a significant amount in the organisations in Geneva. 

Again, Geneva will survive - and there are surely people who would be happy to see the UN bodies minimized or removed but it's not just about the Americans themselves staffed there. Apart from a very select group of agencies that prohibit staffing for non-member states in their body, for Americans themselves, it'll be more or less equal impact as any other staffer in that organisation - not good.",Geneva

"Cycled there a few times, it's very easy and relatively safe (at least at the douane level - on the French side they're making improvements and getting there but unless you stay in Ferney or Pr‚vessin or Ornex at most, beyond that it gets pretty tricky). If you cycle past the main douane just by the tunnel that goes underneath the tarmac, there is a separate section in the tunnel for bikes (and it's separated from the cars by a wall so you are very safe). And then when you exit the tunnel it leads you towards a bike path/shortcut that gets you into the middle of Grand-Saconnex fairly quickly and easily :) 

Of course be aware of your surroundings and be respectful of others and the rules. Geneva is great for cycling (we don't have a car, we mainly cycle or take the bus), much better than our experience when we lived in London.

I imagine you are young and willing to rent a room but if you are staying here for the long run I would suggest to hunt for your own place. More expensive ? Maybe (not always if you find a not too expensive studio or a 2 piece), but much more freedom, quietness and privacy. Having said that (again) let?s say you are a FIRE kind of person: a 3 piece is easily 600 chf more than a room so if you are staying for the long run, that living room will cost you 72k after 10 years.

"Is that a normal price? No.
But unfortunately, that's the price they think people are able to pay to travel in this country, for some reason.

As others have said, supersaver fares are great if you know which train you're going to take (and that you are sure you're not going to miss it). Although, you're probably only be able to see these fares by searching for GenŠve - Renens in the app, and from Satigny as well as towards EPFL, you can take normal bus tickets.

Something else that can be cheaper if you book waaayyy in advance is municipality day passes, you can have a look at that link for availability :
https://www.cartejournaliere-commune.ch/en
But you'll have to go to your local town hall to buy them. In this case you won't spare much, but it's a day pass for the entire country so if you need to go someplace further one day, it might really be worth it.

Finally, if you don't end up using either, you should definitely use EasyRide, it's in the app itself. I'm still not sure how, but that thing sometimes magically finds you fares that you can't find otherwise, so many times did it gave me a price that was always lower than expected.",Geneva

"On a motor home, it will be difficult to park in Geneva. I can recommend the camping TCS Vesenaz, and the restaurant is quite good if you like meat (their specialty is charbonnade, grilled meat on a charcoal grill on your table with sauces and French fries). You might have to book though. From there you can also take public transportation, and check the schedules on the TPG site from Vesenaz to Geneva downtown (it should take about 20 minutes). For the restaurants, you already have good names.

The other campsites in Geneva are quite crap, don?t try them. You have another TCS campsite in Lausanne (Vidy)which is nice too. Lausanne might be more alive than Geneva for New Year?s Eve.

Then put the desiccant inside. Absorb the last of the moisture.

"La Chƒtaigneraie is based in Canton Vaud, in Founex. While close to Geneva, it is not in Geneva but in what we could call the ®ÿcountrysideÿ¯ (which is still densely populated, but I wouldn?t call it suburbs). You should be able to find a lovely rental property for your budget (house) in the villages around (Founex, Commugny, etc ? which usually are pretty sweet and typical). However, it will not be like living in downtown Geneva. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it; it just depends on the lifestyle you want. Think also that the commuting will be longer and you might not have all the facilities around and might need a car - which is usually not necessary in Geneva at least to commute.

The job depends on your qualifications?there are English-speaking jobs in Geneva in Finance, pharma, and, of course, international organisations, although most of the time, they will still prefer someone who has some basic knowledge of the local language.

When we left the restaurant to go to our car we didn?t notice he had followed us with his friend to exact revenge for the rejection. When he started threatening us, I said I am calling the police, he got close to me, tall guy with big muscles and promised to beat the hell out of me if I brought my phone out of my bag, I have never been that scared in my life, I have always felt protected in Switzerland, in my little town in Vaud, as teenager I used walk back from the bars and nightclub alone where I grew up alone, passing through parks and shortcuts without light and I was never scared.

For geneva, Lausanne, montreux you can take the train. Its really efficient and the travel time is no more than 1 or 1.5 hrs

Infact you can cover both montreux and Lausanne in the same day.

I would suggest to go to Montreux early morning from geneva. Explore it. Go to Rochers de Naye  (theres a train that goes there and is covered by GA card)

After montreux, travel back to Lausanne 

Explore Lausanne and old town. Visit EPFL if you want 

On the way back, you can stop at Nyon too. Its also a really pretty place.
And then finally geneva


For Annecy, I'd suggest keep a whole day. You can use the train from geneva or alternatively you can also use FlixBus too. FlixBus would be alot cheaper option.

Explore annecy for a whole day.

And your third day, explore geneva ,old town, cern and others.

"IIL alumni here!

Geneva private schools are absolutely great, but it puts the students in a bubble that is not necessarily the real world.
It is quite hard to move back to the public system after being in a private school, so once you commit to it, you are left with having to pay the tuition fees for the next 10-15 years. 

Students in these schools are usually very privileged, so attending these schools doesn't guarantee a great success in life (most of my friends never graduated college because they didn't need it). However, if your kid loves school and likes to learn, IIL provides an awesome learning environment. 

If you are not sure of the commitment, you can also put your kid in public school (especially if they speak french) and put them in private school during cycle or high school, which would prepare them for potentially studying in the US - and you'd be able to tell if your kid likes school or not). 
If you choose the public school path, they can also do a English-French bilingual maturity which is quite helpful to study abroad as well.
