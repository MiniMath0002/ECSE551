1,"I checked the prices at the axe throwing to get an idea of your budget.  

Really the only things I could think of coming in under $100 would be to go to one of the arcades, or one of the bars like reload or kingpin. bowling.  Maybe some of the challenge rooms at hijinx hotel? (Would come in under $50 for 2 people doing 5 rooms)  hijinx hotel also has mini golf."
2,"Best: small population, clean air, decent job market, close to nature. 

Worst: insane cost of living. Tiny, depressing apartment for 40-50% of your take home is the norm. Forget eating out. Nothing to do. Homeless people roam the city and crime goes unpunished as a policy (e.g. police won't investigate theft less than 2,000 dollars, and they wont send a car out for home break-ins, both stated and official policies)."
3,"Superbarn Casey is decent for bulk packs. Usually have Rib-eye Fillet, Porterhouse, Rump, or Fillet Steak whole packs on special from $21-30 a kilo.

Not the absolute best, but well priced. Get a good butcher's knife, as you'll want to do some trimming at home, but good enough to be everyday steak for me (with some nice treats from Bayldon or the Capital Market butcher thrown in too)."
4,"Is that “Suicide Towers” on the bottom left?
A mate lived there albeit it briefly in the late 90s. His neighbour was a nymphette nurse that had men over at all hours (she was loud) on one side and an elderly woman from Bucharest that had cats multiplying at an alarming rate on the other. The wind stank of cat. Services eventually removed her (and the vast clowder)."
5,Hey friend! Sharing the boat with you. I'm booked for the next month off work for the exact same reason. My GP is Dr Larissa Prior at East Canberra GP and she is wonderful. I hope you can get through this tough time.
6,"I've spent about 10 days in the office in 2 years, but I'm starting to sense people (particularly newer managers) trying to pull people back in.

My agency has avoided making any policy since the new EA because none of them want to deal with it."
7,"Used to have one in Braddon, but it shut down. I was so cut! 

There aren’t any that are the ones you’re thinking of, but Lim Peh in Westfield Woden at least serves cheong fun. 

Dordor Noodles and also Ming’s Pantry do decent Hongkie drinks. Dordor does an okay baked rice - portions could be a lot bigger. 

Tak Kee takes me back to Hong Kong tbh, but in a lunch/ dinner sense. I really need someone to do Hongkie breakfast here.  Again, there used to be one that shut down in Braddon and they did the breakfast and their own bolo bao - I’m still so cut about it. 

Welcome to Canberra!"
8,"I swim in Lake Burley Griffin fairly regularly between November and April. I’ve swum in several of the other places mentioned, but I much prefer the Lake due to proximity, its size and depth particularly at the Western end around the rowing course. 

The ACT Government tests the water every week for algae/bacteria levels/water temp etc. This data informs the Swim Guide app to guide you on where it is safe to swim. 

The pontoons at Black Mountain Rowing Club on the Black Mountain Peninsula are one of the easiest places to access the lake. The water quality between there and Scrivener Dam is pretty good, but check the Swim Guide app first. 

If you’re interested in a dip sometime happy to come with - just DM me. It’s a sublime way to cool off on a hot Canberra afternoon/evening."
9,Canberra Southern Cross Club yacht club at Yarralumla has a nice vibe overlooking the lake. You can rent the balcony to use as a private space but it is usually not very crowded so you can just grab a corner of the bar area or balcony.
10,"Some indicative rates here: [https://www.galvanizedfitness.com.au/personal-trainers-in-canberra](https://www.galvanizedfitness.com.au/personal-trainers-in-canberra)

11,"Not aware of *any* courses for roped climbing, but I would perhaps contact ""Canberra Friendly Rock-climbing"" group on FB - I know they do guided climbs.

Also ANU Mountaineering Club or [https://sportclimbingact.org/](https://sportclimbingact.org/)

You'd have more luck up in the Blue Mountains, perhaps."
12,"There’s also Prismatic Privileges in Kambah. Hayley designed her salon with neurodiverse people in mind and has been an absolute god send for me and my group of ND family with a variety of sensory needs between us. She’s incredibly kind and understanding and is an absolute magician. I’ve followed her from her previous salon and in 5 years, I’ve never ever had a bad cut and that includes when she rescued me from an absolute hack job some trendy wanker decided I needed instead of what I asked for."
13," [W Patisserie](https://www.wpatisserie.com.au/?srsltid=AfmBOooSHGNHeumGcRCWx9KgHIIauCm83QTgtsIl_bj1xM9Jf4WNZeAB) makes amazing creations with creamy layers, and interesting flavours.    Kotesh has his own distinct style, which tend more to the dessert/entrement side rather than just plain cake with icing."
14,"I was in hungry jacks once and kids came flooding out of the playground squealing. I could see liquid dripping down the levels of the playground. Then a kid came down, pants covered in piss. A 16 year old HJ employee walked past and I let him know there was piss all through the playground.

Told me ""fuck that, I'm not cleaning that shit""

15,">I’m curious (and possibly others are too) about what secret gems are out there.

You won't be told a lot, most of the secret gems are pretty strictly need-to-know. 

There was the ATO SAN outage and a few other big ones that were fun all around. 

Other than that look at big tender news announcements for large projects, they can be somewhat fun if that's what you're into (or a whole lot of pain)"
16,"I thought it was just me, but I went a few Sundays ago and I could call out but I had no data it did say I had two bars of service. I even rebooted but that did not help. I had the same issue the Friday before Xmas but I thought I was because the mall was so busy"
17,"I take my 1985 Husqvarna Classica 100 to Mohamed in Charnie and he previously fixed a blown chip. He’s fabulous and services a huge range of machines from vintage to new:

18,"Kalulas in Perth is what bulk stores used to be. A place to shop in bulk because it was cheaper, not because it was a trendy lifestyle fad. I’m all for low-waste living, but it’s ruined the primary purpose of bulk stores. I left Perth a few years back and haven’t found anywhere comparable, sadly.
Your best bet in Canberra would be a random Asian grocer or the Nut Shop at the Fyshwick Markets, though it’s definitely not as cheap as it used to be back in the day."
19,"No suggestions, but also consider that Valentines Day is really just a date and if 9pm doesnt work for you for work reasons, you could make the effort to do a special romantic dinner on the 15th or some other date too :) will probably be less busy too!"
20,I predict someone gets arrested in Brandon on Saturday night for almost killing a civilian with their illegally modified car by doing a burnout whilst police watch helplessly as their is only 6 of them rostered for the city.
21,"Before you do any career change and rack up a high HECS debt you need to see if tech is going to suit you. You need to ask yourself will tech give you the fulfilment, meaning and purpose you are not getting in allied health. Reflection on who you are, personality, values and skills need to be considered closely when making a big change. You need to identify the job outcome you are aiming for before you can consider whether the job opportunities lie in Sydney or Canberra."
22,"I think it is okay as a starting point, though I don't know what the strata fees are like. The commute time and maintenance in the Gungahlin area is ridiculous at times for such a small town, but one day it might improve. I have always preferred closer in front of Gungahlin (ended up in Harrison in the end), but each to their own and understand work location and pricing are priority factors. Hopefully you also have friends to mingle with to make things easier."
23,"Why have the ACT government considered the cost of operating (a 25m versus a 50m pool) at all, since they are not the ones that will be operating it?

And even so, the owners are currently operating a really old 50m pool - surely it will be much cheaper to operate a brand new 50m pool… although perhaps the water bill will be high if it leaks as much as most Geocon buildings?

I think the people calling out ‘corruption’ all the time are simply assuming that it must occur, since it is hard to assume sometimes why the ACT doesn’t occasional actually hold a developer to a condition when it doesn’t suit them? I mean, Geocon could probably just build a bigger pool and make less profit - this doesn’t HAVE to be about housing costs increasing…"
24,"Wet bulb is 18C, your evap should be pretty damn nice right now. I definitely don't recommend evap for canberra though because although those humid heats are (historically) rare here they're the days you absolutely want max AC. Pulling the ducts/vents and getting 1 or 2 appropriately sized mini splits is usually the best bang for buck, you may want solar first though."
25,"I mentioned this on another post a few weeks ago, it’s seems to be absolutely everywhere nowadays, there has always been graffiti in Canberra but it is much worse than I ever remember it being. Construction site in gungahlin town centre is a massive site and every single panel of the construction hoarding was massively tagged within a week."
26,"The Urban Heat Island effect makes me concerned about very high density living. For this reason I believe it is bad for the environment & also for the mental & physical health of those that live in very high density areas. Look at Japan & China. Their birth rates have declined the more high density their living environments are. People are not happy, nor comfortable enough to marry & raise a family in such environments. I would hate to see that happen in Canberra, which until recently has been a great place to raise a family."
27,"I had my hysterectomy done by Dr Uche Menakaya from the Junic clinic. He was fantastic and the first gyno who actually listened to me. I worked with him for a few years for some ongoing issues, and in the end I suggested the hysterectomy as it would solve my health issues and I was not planning on having kids. I had a chat with the practice nurse to confirm it was what I wanted and why, but I never felt like my decision was questioned. 
You could contact the clinic directly, or I'd also recommend an initial chat with someone from SHFPACT, they would have other doctors or services they could refer you to."
28,It was alright. It took us about an hour going pretty slowly and watching almost all the videos. If it weren’t for them we could have even in and out within half an hour. The eruption is quite fun but that’s the only real hook.
29,"I feel you, I am Canadian and keep having to ask people when I'm driving with them if I can turn on this red or not, because I can in Canada. It's getting easier the more I drive, but I miss my turning on reds lol"
30,"As others have said, this is a very quiet time of year, but have you contacted any of the recruitment agencies? Look at Hays, Effective People, Horizon One, face2Face, Randstad, to name just a few. If you Google ""Canberra Recruitment Agencies"" you will get many more. They can get you into the short term contracts that you are looking for. Good luck!"
31,"Yes, you need a roadworthy inspection to clear the notice. Wheels and tyres, lights, indicators, brakes, steering, suspension, indicators, wipers seats and seatbelts will all be checked as part of the inspection.

That is for the ACT. Other states may be different."
32,"I was at Mt Ainslie last night and have to say that it was a pleasant & friendly atmosphere. Lots of tripods and cameras set up to view comet Atlas G3 too. If you go, arrive before sunset because parking was a bit chaotic."
33,"I have the same problem years ago and ended up buying a hobie i9 .

Magic bit of kit, and the new ones look even better.

I bought mine from wetspot (years ago lol) but I know that Boss outdoors in Fyshwick now sell them. They do 'try' days a few times a year and if you ask, they'll try and get the inflatable in for that. 

Better to try before you buy, but since I tried, I've never gone back to the rigid ones. River lake Ocean, the Hobies are a great boat and well worth the money."
34,"This one is pretty clear...

Much more fun is the corner of Florey Drive and Lhotsky Street, not far away

You can turn off Lhotsky Street in to Florey Drive - there is a concrete island but there is no ""Give Way"" - it's (technically) two lanes for 30 metres then ""Lane One Form"" - then another hundred metres to a roundabout. More than a few people have conniptions there. Not made any better by the fact that there is a fairly large, permanent, 40K zone - with a 40K school zone inside it - so, many people mistakenly assume that the 40K is only school hours (really it's just a higher fine, some of the time - and more confusion...)"
35,"Contrary to a lot of posts here this doesn't appear to be Starlink but China's Thousand Sails.

36,"Good neighbours, there is a community feel, especially in some streets than others. Few stops to reach gungahlin and then tram if working in city. Nice walking tracks bordering the reserve and inside Mulligan's flat. There were robbery issues a few years ago, just like in other canberra suburbs, but not anymore.  Many young families.                                                                                  Cons : no shops but short distance to gungahlin shops. No idea: not sure about the school as my kids don't attend this school."
37,"There are a number of HPC devices in ""interesting"" organisations.


PenTen, Cydarm and a heap of other Cybersecurity focused Firms.

Naval Radar manufacturing (CEA Technologies), Lockheed Martin, Thales, BAE, Raytheon, Viasat all have a presence.

A ton more System Integrators like DXC, Leidos, Fujitsu do all sorts of interesting government work.

Also lots of OT environments that run Critical infrastructure."
38,"Canberra should probably be more friendly to building housing, and get over the pretentious 10-storey aesthetic limits. The ""bush capital"" low density philsophy to housing doesn't seem compatible with Australia's growth or need for more housing stock. 

BUT it also deserves some credit for not following the path of Melbourne, which thoughtlessly and aggressively turns paddocks that are halfway to Albury into new ""suburbs"" with zero transport, schools, or other amenities, and just rams them full of immigrants who need a place to live and know no better.

Melbourne's traffic is beyond stupid, because of its thoughtless, unplanned expansion and shocking public transport.

On an unrelated note, Australia has somewhere around 1 million vacant properties. I've always wondered why we don't heavily incentivise owners renting them out (not Airbnb) or disincentivise owners leaving them empty. But that'd be because both Liberal and Labor are spineless copies of one another that pay lip service only to the housing problem because home owners are their biggest voting constituancies."
39,Public heath - It’s all a con.  I’m 18 months into treatment for BC through Canberra Hospital and I had to pay $113 for a mandatory bone density scan at the hospital for my oncologist.  I know the cost of living has gone up for food and we have everyone complaining bitterly but the cost of ‘free’ Medicare is terrible both for what is covered and how much we get back.
40,"Canberra has such a transient and wealthy population, and modern furniture is so crappy, you’d be better off looking for an older Molmic or other $$$$$$ sofa on Facebook or gumtree, and get it steam cleaned. Will last you a couple of lifetimes!"
41,"The rental market is nowhere near as competitive as other major cities, however the bar for entry is much higher. So if you meet that bar it's easier.

The market is also skewed, units and apartments are very competitive as they are favoured by students and grads and single public servants. There is much much less competition for townhouses and houses (3+ bedrooms) as immigrants with families (largest competitors in other cities for these properties) are ineligible for work in the aps. You need to be a citizen.

From this, your friend is going to have an awful time. He cannot afford a house large enough for his family on his income in almost any suburb. Definitely not googong. And if he tries to get a small place he can afford, he will have an awful time applying, real estate will not look favourably on missed rent in his history, and he may push reasonable occupancy limits. Then if he does find a small place living in it overcrowded will be rough."
42,"As a Kmart worker (not in Canberra but another big city) I can tell you that the main problem is severe budget cuts this time of the year. After Christmas they pretty much only have the skeleton staff on, and stores are allocated pitiful wages. This mean the team of teenagers (who admittedly aren’t great workers half the time) who are supposed to tidy the store at night is very small - some nights my store has only had like 4/5 people on to fix up the whole store. The day staff don’t have time to fix up all the shelves on top of all the load they need to fill. It’s honestly ridiculous how much money that company makes but how little money they give stores for wages."
43,"Intra Cafe

Expensive. Coffees aren’t great considering their price and how long it takes. Staff are absolutely pretentious and think they’re all holier-than-thou. Food is nothing amazing (also considering the price).

Add Les Bistronomes to the list too. It’s okay, but it doesn’t deserve the fanfare that it receives."
44,There's a place in the belconnen mall that sells second hand instruments and audio equipment I think it's like a revolution CD? It's directly above commbank I sold some stuff there a while back. I'm not 100% sure it is still there however.
45,"Yes the days & hours listed are the times at which the restrictions are in operation. All other times are free. And not all of the bays have the same rules, and there are even parking spaces on the road, so look in more than one place. As for checking tickets, I have parked there for short periods without paying but have no experience of long sessions."
46,"Might be of interest to you, Jolt Games is doing a few build and paint workshops on a few Saturdays. They are in Mitchell, a hop skip and a jump from EPIC

47,"This sort of thing is actually fairly common. While most of the doctors at Winnunga Aboriginal Health Service are very good, one of them is well known for being Transphobic. She once told a Trans patient ""I'll help you with everything else, but I won't help you with that"", referring to Trans healthcare issues that the patient had just asked about. Mind you, she's also well know for having really bad doctor to patient care as well."
48,"Best: Lots of nature close by, short commutes, safe, 4 distinct seasons, housing cheaper than Sydney, well established suburban bike paths, and it's a pretty city (though that is subject to personal taste).

Worst: Limited day trip/weekend away options within 1-2 hours, fewer high profile events than larger cities, the decentralised nature of the multiple city centres means the CBD isn't as vibrant as a more centralised city, and winter is properly cold."
49,"I had very heavy and crippling menstruation, but my gyno refused an ablation when I was 35 and already a mum. Convinced me to get a mirena and it was the worst decision I ever made. Instead of improving my periods, it made me bleed for 12-15 days per month every month, and my poor partner was getting stabbed by the protruding wire (ouch!). And I ended up with breast cancer at 40, which I believe may have been helped along by the progesterone. Please advise your friend to stick to her guns and don’t be swayed into alternatives without some serious research and consideration."
50,"I love Blue Eyes - it’s a jazz bar and I believe they have a live jazz band on Fridays and Saturdays. If you wanted it to be quieter of course you could go when there isn’t live music, although the atmosphere with the jazz band is amazing! Wasn’t super busy last time I was there - it’s got a great vibe and feel to it and the staff are excellent."
51,"Always chaos I go there more than I’d like to admit and I have to say the toy section is the worst 
Second is the gym stuff there is always spilt drinks on the shelves or half empty drinks that are mouldy 
The dog toys are chaotic too 

The staff just don’t seem to care nor do they want to help you find something as they don’t even know where things should be

I don’t bother checking to see if something is in stock online anymore as each time I’ve looked in store there’s none available but states it is in stock

The theiving I’ve witnessed there is unbelievable. 

The whole store needs to be closed for a week for a deep clean and restock"
52,"There are a few spots on Anketell st, between the pool and Cowlishaw st. Most of them have 2 hour limit but some don't.
There are some on Scollay st, near the recycling drop off centre. 
As usual, you have to be quite early to get these spots :)"
53,"Messina. 

Like fuck nearly every other gelato place is better, and Frugii was a million times better. 

CBD dumpling though I think they’re decent eat in, but takeaway or delivery it doesn’t travel well, king dumplings travel better and are cheaper."
54,"Used to work for TCCS, the artics (articulated buses) are still around.

The orange buses were supposed to be decommissioned years ago as they dont have ramps and cant kneel, to allow easy access for elderly/disabled people. but they keep getting extensions to keep them around.

Also worth noting that what they say about transitioning the fleet to electric is dumb. They can only charge 2-3 busses at belco at a time or they risk drawing too much power and taking the grid down. Some Tuggers buses (the gas ones), the ac unit on top looks taller, need to be refulled mid day yet they send it up to charnwood empty to then drive all the way back on its normal routes. Would be smarter to have it start its route in tuggers. But nope thats too smart for the idiots that run the place"
55,"Building across from me has slightly mirrored windows. Which results in some amazingly unknown nudity in the evening because when it’s dark outside and they have lights on, it flips the mirror so they don’t realise everyone can see in. 

Had one bloke get out of the shower and then just stand there watching tv with one foot up on the couch arm airing his balls out while they dried."
56,"What is CanCon like for other pop culture fans? I know it's mostly tabletop games like Warhammer or DnD and so on... Is there much other stuff like  a traditional ""-con""?

Pokemon cards, anime, video games and that sorta thing? Or is it very much focused on tabletop games?"
57,"Don't go to the coast until they are protected - paralysis ticks are in Canberra but rampant on the coast. I use nexgard, you can get one that includes heartworm but I get my dogs the yearly shot so get the one without."
58,"Residents would no longer be able to challenge development approvals for public housing and public health facilities in the ACT's administrative tribunal under a Labor government plan intended to speed up the projects.  


Planning Minister Chris Steel will on Wednesday introduce a bill to automatically classify public housing and public health facilities as territory priority projects under the ACT's planning system, declaring the tribunal cases are ""unfair"" to people waiting for public homes.

""We've seen far too many instances of delays to already approved public housing projects from costly appeals,"" Mr Steel said.

""This law means public housing and health facilities that significantly benefit the people of the ACT can be rolled out without unnecessary delays.""

The government said there had been 20 applications to the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal challenging public housing developments since 2019, and 13 per cent of total appeals to the tribunal in the last five years related to public housing development applications.

""Canberrans waiting for housing often have no voice in the planning system to support housing proposals that would provide them with shelter, especially when these proposals are appealed by those who seek to overturn already approved housing on a range of grounds both planning and non-planning related,"" Mr Steel said in a statement.  


""Ultimately it is people on Canberra's public housing waiting list who are impacted by the delays and blockages directly as a result of appeals to ACAT. This is unfair.""

More than 75 per cent of those appeals were resolved through mediation or by the tribunal agreeing with the original decision to approve the development, the government said.

Mr Steel said Canberrans would still be able to comment on development applications through the independent planning process, but the change would exempt approved public housing and health developments from third-party appeals.

""This bill is a practical measure to remove barriers to a home for families on Housing ACT's waiting lists,"" he said.  


The Planning (Territory Priority Project) Amendment Bill 2025 will be introduced to the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday and add, if passed, new definitions for territory priority projects to cover public housing and public health facilities."
59,"Any of the nicer restaurants will be able to cater for vegans, if you'd like the date to be a bit more of a treat; there are also cheaper options, so if Pilot in Ainslie is OTT, Edgar's vegan degustation also comes highly regarded.

I've always had a good time as a vegan at Lazy Su, Akiba and especially Bar Beirut. There are a few more vegan restaurants such as Sweet Bones and Muku Ramen (both in Scullin) or vegetarian-can-be-made-vegan restaurants across the city, such as Stand By Me (in Lyons). For date night at home, Utopia Vegan is the other vegan restaurant in Dickson."
60,"Agree on needing to think about 3D designs not flat images.  They need to make it as accessible as possible to people all across the lake, not just a premium experience in one spot.  Where we were looking if it was a flat image all we could see really was the side of it."
61,"Argh! We really need an add campaign along the lines of ""Come to Canberra, do crime and get away with it""

Sarcasm aside, I'm getting fed up with out lousy so called justice system letting criminals go. :("
62,"The real slap in the face is from rugby leagues, teams, and fans to ACT taxpayers every time they demand that we pay to provide them with a new stadium. Take the hint--we've got other priorities. If you want a new stadium, pay for it yourselves."
63,"Hi
If they are not in a sensitive area and they are slowly spreading and growing in number…

I got SWIFT microwave. It zaps your warts and gets the immune system fighting them over time, and leaves no scars, burns or marks. See a podiatrist like Canberra Podiatry. I have pics on my Reddit of results.

It’s the only thing that worked for me and I tried everything.

Quick, painful zaps once a month, 3-5 treatments, $200 odd per treatment, no dressings required.
You might say “3-5 months that’s ages!” Guarantee you any other method will take just as long, be more painful and a constant dressing, bandaid and time exercise."
64,"There are some people that live in Sydney - come to Canberra Monday morning for the work week and then leave Thurs/Friday. 

I’d jump on all the Canberra noticeboard Facebook groups to see if you can give someone $50 towards petrol."
65,"And this is why the tower “restaurant” space needs to be confiscated from Telstra and put on a long term lease to ACT Tourism (who sub let it at discounted rates to a local restaurant business).  

On a side note, I just read the wonderful Chez Frederick in Braddon has closed because of costs….."
66,"Big box bbq, the only burger they do is a brisket burger, but it's really fucking good.

Also if you're a fan of smoked meats it's also great.

No idea where they'll be as it's only a food truck, but if they're around definitely hit it up."
67,"Still does stink sometimes. If you live there you get to experience the environment 24/7. There has been a lot of work to improve things: artificial wetlands on the Mawson side of Drakeford Drive, rain garden in Isabella Plains, doesn’t stop Lake Tuggeranong being an artificial lake.

You should visit for a while especially on the sunny days following rain."
68,"Funny you say not just wood fired, I literally consider different pizza types as different foods. 

Comparing Italian to Chicago to NY (and to Detroit) you may as well be comparing pizza to lasagne or pizza to a toasty.

There's also a third type - American style chain pizza, which is probably closest to NY of this style, but very different again. Generally American chain pizza is the worst, has the most ingredients, but is the cheapest - and serves a purpose for serving a big group of people at the last minute (or watching footy etc)

Yet to find amazing pizza in Canberra after being spoilt for choice in Sydney (but only really looked in Belco area, I'm sure there are great options in the city) - Pop is good but over priced, Artigiana probably my favourite overall. Both are fairly traditional Italian style. Bronx in Gungahlin is decent but definitely not traditional, it's like American chain style, but fancier (which is almost traditional Aussie ??)

Not going proper NY or Chicago style in Canberra, Grease Monkey do good Detroit style."
69,"The aquarium and dinosaur museum, would rank pretty low on my list of places to visit.    
Depending on what you are into the Pompeii Exhibition at the National Museum of Australia is the thing to see.  
But also most of the other things mentioned by others are worth going to.    
Braddon has a lot of places to eat so should be fine there. Nothing much in Mitchell really to eat its mostly an industrial area there."
70,"Fingers crossed it does not suck.


Excuse my cynicism, just after all these years in power the Labor party just seem to be the party made up of and for the developers.


Also is Richard Snow, from the family that owns the airport?  If so that would be on brand for our little city."
71,"Felishna O'Pearn is in Canberra at the moment to host an event, it was likely announced that it will host the first ever live music festival on September of next month and will host a concert in Brisbane in September for a concert of its kind at a venue called a the Australian Hotel and Bar at which it will be hosting the first concert. It was probably fireworks lit by Felishna O'Pearn herself"
72,"I learnt for a while at Peter Morton's academy of Jiu Jitsu. 
Are you also looking for a community, friendships  in the martial arts? Usually community clubs are best for this. 
Akido is also an option. 

I'd start with a school hall one to see if you like as they are also generally cheaper than ones with their own dojo."
73,"Only if it has a sign saying left turn permitted on red.

Just spend a couple of days or weeks building a proof of concept, present it to a bunch of executives, and then move on to the next opportunity.

Being part of the sales team also pays way better than doing development. If you have technical skills but can also talk about technical concepts in a way that non-techies can understand, and don't mind a bit of public speaking it's a pretty easy job to get into.

3. If you're looking for something that leans a bit towards cool and fun over practical but dull, and especially if we're talking Jimnys, you can consider grey imports from Japan for more options (and oh look, here's a [Redriven video about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQJA3TPwtgM) as well.

110,"This article is misleading, all resting on the premise that on the week of Summernats (which coincides with New Years and holidays) you see increased calls to a sexual assault line which are likely caused by other factors.  The ABC need to do better than this.

The article does get it right that things have changed at Summernats quite a lot. I was there yesterday with my kid and although predominately guys, there were lots of families and kids and as well as women and girls. I saw zero harassment or anything at all disrespectful and never have over the years I have taken my kid.

I think one should put it into context, Summernats is certainly not the ballet, there is alcohol and lots of guys but disrespectful behavior towards women is no longer encouraged or celebrated.  I suspect it is no different to going to any other large event with a lot of alcohol such as the footy or a big open air concert, the risk is higher but not accepted."

114,"Snow fucked us over by building shops and offices on federal land which side skirts ACT planning. It is in the middle of nowhere, no one is casually walking to their local shop at Majura park. 99.99% of people are driving there to shop or work. This sucks and makes our city less dense and less walkable. It is an airport, it has to be there for noise restrictions. Put the cool stuff, like shops and commercial in real town centres, the ones with people in them. Everything built out there that isn't an airport drains the life from our city.

As far as renting office space out there, I purposely chose my current company based on being able to get to it via light rail to civic. When applying for jobs I immediately ignore any at Brindabella park. So the rent there might be cheap, but you are only going to get certain groups of workers, I'm probably not the only one who hates Brindabella park. And no, this is not a reason to build the light rail to the airport. Fuck Snow and his family. Build light rail to every single other town centre first, then the Snow family can pay us to build it out to the airport."

123,"Hello! Short answer to your question is either Murrays bus or train from Sydney. 

Not sure if you're east coast or west coast US, but the distance from Sydney-Canberra is similar to Seattle-Portland or a bit less than NYC-Boston. So yeah, there are flights, but if you're not in a great rush, just makes more sense to go overland. I'd recommend train if you want comfort and food, Murrays coach bus if you want speed and internet. I've found them to be similar prices, and almost always cheaper than the short flight. 

As for effective modes of ground transportation to Melbourne and Brisbane... Depends what you mean by effective? There are trains, and coach buses (Greyhound, Premier Motor Services, Firefly), linking those 3 cities. Sydney-Melbourne is around 11 hours by train, and you can do it as a comfortable overnight trip. You could even do Canberra as a stopover between Sydney and Melbourne, albeit an imperfect one. Canberra is in between Sydney and Melbourne - that's actually the whole reason it exists as the capital city - but there's no direct Canberra-Melbourne trains, so it'd be 1 hour extra on a train or coach to connect back to the main Sydney-Melbourne line at either Goulburn or Yass. But those are both charming little country towns in their own right, very different vibe to the big cities and worth seeing, even if briefly. 

Another little heads-up if you're interested in ground transportation - in Southeast Queensland (so that's Brisbane, but also Gold Coast & Sunshine Coast where the beaches are), all trips by train, bus and river ferry only cost [$0.50 AUD](https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/50-cent-fares) (i.e. 50 cents). And in Victoria (the state that has Melbourne), public transport is capped at [$11 AUD per day](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/introducing-fairer-fares-for-regional-victorians/), including long-distance regional travel, so if you do get the train between Sydney-Melbourne, you could try stopping at Albury-Wodonga (town at the border between Victoria and New South Wales) and booking a V-Line train between Melbourne-Albury, might work out cheaper!"

Would have been possible if the Monaro crossed Canberra Ave a little further west but that wasn’t possible because of Jerrabomberra Creek. So you see on a map the Monaro curves over Canberra Ave and cuts the space where an off ramp would join Canberra Ave. ."

147,"Maybe going to a tafe/technical college is a better option. I own an accounting and part of a law firm-  the graduates coming out after 3y/5y of study are fucking useless honestly. I won’t hire anyone from ANU (my last 2 good hires came from Wagga). 

When I went through, I was a P’s get degrees student (partying and drinking from 11am). In 2nd year, I got a part time job in an accounting firm, which set my marks from F/P average to a C/D average - as I was actually working in what I was studying. 

Most “degrees” should be 1-1.5year courses teaching the basic stream in that field followed by actual work (even engineering should have a pre-specialisation before moving to a full engineering degree). Don’t get me wrong - there are parts of a degree that aren’t initially useful but knowledge of them is important (eg I hated stats, but I have used it or referred work elsewhere to get analysis done; I’m not in marketing, but those units 20 years ago were invaluable during an MBA). 

I see many degrees now require a year or two of actual work before full conferral (eg physio)

Don’t get me started with alternative medicine etc. universities aren’t what they used to be - they were a social hub where ideas could be shared. This online class rubbish doesn’t allow the sharing of ideas - I still remember arguing in 1st year law that teaching accounting ethics (after Enron/AA) was a waste of time if there is a fiduciary duty for directors to maximise profits of shareholders - and professionals are always looking for loop holes (just look at the state/quality of construction in Australia) - there is no pride jn an profession and we can legislate and regulate until we go blue… but if there is no enforcement then what’s the point."

157,"I was laid off about 10 years ago and part of my transitional package I was set up with LHH Knightsbridge. They were great for helping me update my CV, application optimization, etc. 

However, only piece of advice I’d give you is be very careful leaving your current job if it’s still safe. There’s a lot of uncertainty these days with many private as well as public positions becoming redundant. Personally I wouldn’t leave a job where I might have some security for a gamble during uncertain times. It might go well, but depending on what industry you’re in and what industry you want to go to, it might be a bit risky. "

164,"Someone posted a few months ago that the overflow Park and Ride at Place in the covered area was closed (that is, they took down the signs saying it was overflow Park and Ride parking - you can still park there for going to the mall.)

The diligence of security likely depends on how long your car sits there and how you act. If you park there, walk off away from the mall, and leave it for a week, they'll probably notice and do something about it. If you park there and go into the mall during regular opening hours to walk through to catch a bus and come back later that day, they probably won't."

There are also companies in town like Wall Sound, Bespoke and Event Design that will sometimes need on-call stagehands, they may be worth a phone call.

It's a great career that's taken me all over the world, but please be aware that the early years are likely to be a lot of cobbling together 4-hour shifts unloading trucks and running cable through the mud, with terrible hours that can be hard on families or relationships.

A few of my friends were teachers and for awhile, there was very few teaching jobs available (that has changed) . The ones that couldn’t get into the public sector went and taught private. I’m not saying that’s all schools and a teacher may have a reason other than financial to work at a specific private school however public school teaching jobs are prized for their benefits, and job security.

Our latest episode was with someone dropping by to feed geese last winter. By spring there was a Norway rat invasion.


As far as ducks go, training them to come for food gets them shot on opening day in September.


Feed a fox or coyote, they'll get shot too.

Even a tweety bird feeder attracts rats and hawks looking for an easy meal."
189,"This is the hard reality no one wants to actually admit but is 100% factual.

""The animals can take care of themselves""

*NOT WHEN WE DESTROY 90% OF THEIR FOOD SOURCES AND HABITAT*

Yes, if they had wild space that produced their natural foods, they would fend fine for themselves.  *But in a city they dont!*

So the truth is, if you want to see wild animals thriving in our natural areas, or even city parks with large untouched forested areas, the animals become largely dependent on humans, and its usuall our garbage and discarded food.  Its the literal reason ""you dont see (x) birds"" or ""you dont see a lot of (x) birds"" like people or you did 20+ years ago, because the populations have gone down and most of our areas we pretend are for nature and animals, have minimal food producing plants, and major amounts of human garbage and food waste, or animal waste, that dont sustain the variety if animals we should be seeing.

Im not defending or justifying what these ladies are doing, personally i go with a large variety of grains, seeds, and nuts, and bird feeders, but the truth in terms of helping ensure your local wildlife population thrives and is diverse, it does require people to provide the animals natural foods when the reality is 20 trees on a park surrounded by 500 single houses is the ""natural habitat"" these animals are now living in, or they just die off and dont return.

If people are going to be puttint trash and food waste in our parks, they can also toss seed and grains and nuts around.  

There can absolutely be a distinction between creating wildlife dependent on humans by trying to hand feed and ""bait"" feeding, and spreading food material in areas the animals should already be in but we have removed so much of their habitat and most of their food sources.  Like how people hang bird feeders. But seeing pigeons refuse human foods after working with squirres to get at a bird feeder i am pro tossing ground seed in lieu of your feeder, chipmunks are too cute damn it.

If we were planting native food sources for the animals in all our parks and pathways we wouldnt see such a drastic difference in wild life (birds mostly) between areas where people have feeders and toss peanuts, compared to places where people dont."

217,"Idk how they're doing on capacity right now but the Ottawa Stray Cat Rescue does great work rehabilitating feral and abandoned cats and getting them to safe warm homes. If you find an abandoned catto, i'm sure both the cat and the shelter would appreciate if you contact them to see what you can do: [https://www.oscatr.ca/](https://www.oscatr.ca/)"
218,"I dk how people think they can watch something while driving. And we have so many features nowdays there's no need to hold a phone to text or call someone. I'm super glad I spent the money on a defensive driving course. I have anxiety issues, but one thing I don't have anxiety with is my driving. I'm alert and watching what's happening, preparing for whatever is ahead. There's no way I would attempt to watch a video at the same time. Yikes."
219,We started working with Oakwood to do a reno of about $100K on our house.  The sales people were great and all went well until we sat down to look at the contract.  The first red flag was that they wanted to review the contract with us in their office without providing a copy for us to review at our leisure.  The second red flag was that the final project cost was not guaranteed - first we had to complete the design phase (3 months) and then they would give the complete cost. If we backed out at this point we still had to pay them 30% of the contract value.  The price of the project also increased by 30% from their preliminary estimate to the price they asked at the contract signing.  There was also a lot of risk shifting from Oakwood to the client in the contract language.  In the end we decided there was too much risk in the contract and walked away.
220,"I would just watch the sens game at home on tv, make a party of it, and actually go to the 67s game. 67s games are way more fun for kids, lots of activities, they can get their picture with the mascot, make signs at intermission etc"
221,"We have the lowest amount of police per capita than anywhere in the country in one of the largest cities. Basically if a couple of duty cars are responding to anything that's about 10% of the active cars on duty. So it isn't surprising there isn't time to set up speed traps or do other basic enforcement. 

For example, I'd be willing to bet that about 1/4 of the police force is always in Lowertown/the Market responding to calls there. You also have mental health cases that can have an officer engaged for hours while they wait at an emergency room."
222,"Shop around with no intention to buy on that day. Once you’ve decided on the model you want, become a member of the APA (I think it stands for Automobiles Protection Agency” or something like that). Along with great reviews and article, they offer a car-buying service in which they have pre-negotiated a competitive price for practically any car you might want. Submit the car you want and they’ll send you a breakdown of the price (including all discounts and dealer incentives) along with the name of the dealer or broker who will sell it to you for that price. Rather than use their dealer, I took their a quote to the dealer who I test-drove with because they had spent time with me. They immediately matched the price rather than lose the sale. Took all the worry and hassle out of negotiations"
223,"I go to CBI Health (specifically sherry at Edgewater). It says 20 but she actually gives more. I’ve never been there less than a hour - usually I’ll see her for 30-40 and then 10 - 20 of heat application. 

She will email the exercises but only the ones she has given me that day (and stretches). 

If I bring a new issue she will listen and provide recommendations. She will test strength in all connecting areas to try to find the root of my issues (MTSS due to weak ass glutes and calf’s) 

I went to one previously I hated it. I won’t even say where because they don’t deserve their name out there lol 

I 100% would recommend a visit to Sherry at CBI."

227,"I would recommend sending your child to a French school/daycare rather than a bilingual or French immersion one, as others have said. It’s very easy to learn and integrate into English in Ottawa, so it’s much more important to continue the French education especially if you’re not speaking French at home. 

I did French immersion at an English school and despite my teachers being Francophones, the learning was just not great because they were hampered by the lesson plans provided by the school board. It wasn’t until I got to university and did French immersion there that I realized how French should have been taught at school. I don’t know a single person who went to a French school in Ottawa that struggles in English, but everyone I know who did French immersion struggles in French."

232,"How about the old Ernestos?

Is it still called Ernestos? He retired a decade or so ago I think it was. It's the one beside Irene's Pub, on Bank St halfway between Holmwood and Fifth.

I haven't been there in quite a while but even with inflation I can't see it being more than the $30 range.

EDIT: What gender haircut are we talking about here?"
233,"I rented a plot at Leslie Park last year, but had also looked at Maple Hill Urban Farm.

Nice thing about Leslie Park is that they organized two nights a week where hoses are taken out for people to water their plots as needed. You do have to volunteer to handle setting up said hoses for 1 week, but it's pretty simple. Very accessible by bike if you don't live too far.

Maple Hill don't provide any water but they seem to provide mulch and organic fertilizer on hand. I might try renting a plot there and specifically plant vegetables that don't need as much watering.

Either way I'm planning on doing it again this year, but keep in mind that your plot will be out of sight, out of mind since it's not in your home. So if you don't check in fairly often, any issues that come up will fester for days before you discover them. I learned the hard way that critters will mow down most unprotected seedlings and so I could only grow a handful of carrots for the entire growing season. But those carrots I grew were the tastiest, sweetest carrots I'd ever eaten by a mile so I'm eager to do better this year."
234,"I don't like cops and don't like to defend them, however there is a shortage and they are dealing with other calls 1st, hence traffic gets snubbed,  but I think they need to be proactive in getting these crazy drivers under control Instead of showing up to so many accidents "
235,"My understanding was their program was separate from the City’s master list, but I could be wrong. We did not enrol in the City master list for this program since we only did 1 day per week, with standard daycare at another facility.

Following up once, twice, maybe even three times per week is the only way to get your desired daycare spots in this City (at least that was my experience)"
236,"Best option by far is surely the traveling Imaginus poster sale, which visits different campuses.

237,"Fix it yourself for $20 with a plug kit from Canadian tire.  Don't listen to all the scaremongering out there, an old school rope plug won't cause your tire to catastrophically fail.  They are not as surefire as a modern plug-patch combo, but they work.  I had a rope plug in a nearly new tire that lasted until the tread wore out.  Honestly a bigger concern with old tires is dryrot causing lamination failure or tread separation.  That can be dangerous.  How old are the tires?"
238,"I’m in no way an expert but I think it really depends on which team they’re playing. When playing against low ranking teams the tickets can be a bit cheaper, but in any case I’d you’ll have a hard time getting out of it for less than $250 for four people if you count taxes, parking and any kind of on-site consumption."
239,"Put an egg carton or cereal box at the very bottom to provide a buffer, then place a couple sheets of newspaper on top of that (grocery store flyers are fine.).  If it does not come out this week, it will come out next.

244,"from ""house creep"": The house portion was built in 1899, back when Parkdale was still known as Queen Street. In 1925, the house was bought by Albert E. Veitch and converted into a funeral home. Was known as Veitch & Son, in 1953, a few years after Albert died, became Veitch-Draper Funeral Home. In 1985, they sold and it became Duncan Funeral Home, with the last funeral work being done in July 1989."
245,"While I absolutely welcome more housing being built, the city has completely lost track of the purpose of zoning. Zoning was meant to separate residential areas from noisy/polluting areas. Now we've rezoned all the land next to noisy/polluting areas for the highest density housing to separate existing residents from future residents. So backwards."
246,"This picture IS hilarious, but this isn't a NIMBY thing. They aren't trying to prevent people from moving into their neighborhood or stopping a business from opening. They are looking out for the well being of their kids. 


I knew Duncan in a past life and he's hilarious. He's always talked like that, but is HIGHLY animated in person, basically a white Jackie Chiles. "
247,"Yes folks, it's Ottawa related and is not, per se, ""promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability"".

  
First, while being a MAGA supporter may indicate certain ...limitations... but none of them are a protected class. So criticizing them is not against the rules.

  
Next, while somewhat transparently karma farming-ish, the subject is relevant and so will be left up.

  
So, keep it cool in the comments and remember that the usual rules apply: no wishing harm on others, no inciting violence or criminal activity etc.  Yes, even towards the orange pile of excrement currently befouling the Oval Office.

248,I lived in the neighborhood for 10 years up until last year and loved it...it's a great quiet little nook in the city. Abbas is a great little store that somehow magically has every last minute thing you could need. 
249,"My dad's 26 year old car in White Rock BC is in better condition than my Ottawa-based 14 year old car.  He never had his car rust treated and I get my car treated with Krown every year.  Ottawa could spend more money on alternatives (e.g., Toronto) if it wasn't so fiscally broke, so instead they just pass the cost on to us by rusting out our cars in record time."
250,The “benches & trees” people are always undercounted in these kinds of surveys. Nobody takes the time to fill out an anonymous online survey to say benches and trees. But lots of us do want benches and trees.
251,"All the Kanata residents cry about the ""horrible drug problems"" or whatever but the real reason I never want to go to Byward is because I have to weave through a bunch of car traffic and parking lots only to be greeted by a dozen tourist traps and no interesting food or shopping. Landsdowne has absolutely nothing to do with it.

Ban cars from Byward. Redevelop the parking lots. Already 10x better."

254,"Word to the wise:
CBC/Marketplace had an article/program 2 weeks ago on how many vet clinics are being corporatized by 3 big private equity/corporations which is driving up prices, lowering care standards and changing the business of pet care. As a result, paw-rents are increasingly surrendering their pet to humane societies bc they can’t afford care. The govt is not tracking the monopoly that is happening. There’s a search engine that allows you to see if your vet clinic/hospital is owned by a corp. My take: pick a clinic that is privately owned. 
Sorry I don’t know how to add the link."

263,"I went to 8 different dealerships in August. By miles and miles, I would recommend a drive out to Carleton Place to Bean Chevrolet. They we're respectful, answered all my questions, didn't rush me, didn't require an advance appointment, and were not bullies and didn't talk down to me. 

Their service counter may be 100% staffed by women.

Every person I have dealt with so far has been polite and professional. 

Oh, and when my new vehicle arrived with a small scratch on a window, they pointed it out to me proactively and already ordered a new one before I even got there. I can certainly imagine other dealerships hoping I missed it then blaming me."
264,"This 1000x!!! I thought I did my due diligence with them, but they’re such crafty bullshit artists. FWIW, we did have a lawyer look at our contract (7 months into to a 3 month reno) and they said they’d love to take it to court, it was so poorly conceived and written."
265,"I watched my neighbour's roofer fall off at the end of the day. He reached for a bucket that was heading off the side.

266,"Jumbo Chinese in Blackburn Hamlet has my favourite chicken balls. Every time I’ve had them they’ve been moist with large chunks of white meat inside.

I also recently tried and loved their crispy beef with peanut sauce, though it’s the only place I’ve ever tried it so I can’t compare to anywhere else.

268,"A couple of years ago I got pulled over for slowly running a red on my bike in broad daylight with no cars around other than the cop who was stopped nearby (i.e. I slowed down and went through when it was clear there was no cross traffic) so I guess there's that.

Cop asked me why I didn't stop, I said it was because it wasn't enforced, cop let me off with a warning without checking my ID. That day I learned that red lights aren't enforced for bicycles."
269,"Honestly... I would not choose them if you have other options.  
Both the (new) staff AND the vet we dealt with there did an incredibly bumbling job of handling our dog's euthanasia. It wasn't so much the medical side, as the social side of things. They even got the dog's name wrong, even after twice reminding them how it was spoken. I could give a whole list of other issues.

(edit: that final appointment was not the only time we've had bad service there, it was just the last one. I would have chosen to go elsewhere long ago, but the dog's other owner made the decisions on where to go, not me)"
270,"the one potential issue that appears to be overlooked is that in winter during parking bans, bank street is the one designated place where you can park your car overnight. there are hundreds of on-street parking cars from First to Holmwood that have to park somewhere else during those bans, and the garage on Second just doesn't have anywhere near enough capacity.

aside from this, i'm guessing that the Glebe BIA members are the main vocal and influential people in opposition to this, because they use the parking on bank to get to work."
271,The traffic that lane closure causes is nuts! Bumper to bumper traffic from St. Laurent to just before Parkdale at 10 on Friday morning is ridiculous. The traffic gets betters instantly once the lane closes.
272,">I really have no idea how they get away with such poor craftsmanship and shotty work.

276,"I took the train to Dow’s Lake with my parents this past Saturday, and it was decently booked with people going skating. Not a full house, but decent numbers going in and out of the train 

Let’s be honest here, the numbers aren’t going to be as high on a weekend, and this line’s busiest stations are always going to be Carleton University, Dow’s Lake and Bayview, no matter the day in question, whereas the other stations won’t see as much traffic, if any. A delayed Sunday launch is unfortunate, but not a massive change in the grand scheme of things"
277,"Has anyone had luck asking these farms for non-Western cuts? I'm talking pork neck bones, beef tendons, beef shank (without the bone). My understanding is most of them get their meat butchered by a third party, and thus don't really control the cuts, but the cuts I use are pretty much only found at Asian grocery stores."

282,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this! 

I was briefly voluntarily admitted to the psych ward about 6 years ago due to suicidal ideation. I didn’t even stay the day because family agreed to supervise me so I asked to leave. They did tell me that if I ever came back for suicidal ideation they would put me on a hold, which means I wouldn’t be allowed to leave for 72 hours. Luckily that hasn’t happened! 

From what I remember (it’s a foggy experience!), I was given my own room with a shared bathroom and a nice meal and some time to rest. On weekdays (possibly weekends as well?) you were not allowed to have your phone with you. On weekdays you were expected to attend regular group therapy sessions and activities. You were allowed visitors. 

It seemed like a lot of people there were pretty unwell, but I didn’t feel unsafe. 

If you are worried for your safety, please don’t hesitate to go to the ER. If you are able to, let some people in your life know what you are going through (even if you think it’s too much or they might not want to help, now is the time to pull on any resources you can!). I went because I was too afraid to tell the people in my life that I was suffering or ask for help. Even though a lot of people in my life at the time sucked even when I did tell them, enough of them were there for me that I was able to pull through that time. 

Wishing you well and lots of healing, please take care! "

My wife gave birth last year at the Montfort, and opted to have a planned c-section to avoid having to go through the stress of the induction process (among other reasons). So many of her friends had inductions where they waited by the phone for days/weeks, kept getting told “it will be tomorrow!” over and over again, finally got induced, laboured for 12-72 hours, and ended up in an emergency c-section."

The 8:35 bus has also been cancelled consistently and then the next one isn't scheduled until 9:12. You'd think at rush hour they'd have more buses, so why is there a 40 minute gap between them?"

297,"They’re celebrating the wrong businesses, but that’s the way the world has shaped the past two generations, and heavily entrenched in the current one.     

These celebrations should be for locally owned and operated businesses, right up to the intellectual property.

300,"Honestly, this is just how the RMV operates. They make no sense, they won’t help you, and you’re pretty much on your own. Good luck. You probably just need a 10-year document that only shows the last few years of records. They’re just looking for whatever official letterhead they require and don’t care about anything else.



For reference, I’ve always had a Massachusetts license, and dealing with the RMV has always been a nightmare, even without complicated paperwork. I’ve had to handle post-accident issues a couple of times, and it was just as frustrating. This is pretty much standard for them."

The owner of this store will always have my deepest respect when I found out many years later he allowed people to get their needed food/items if they did not have money and pay later when they could.  There were no ATM's, banks were closed, most people didn't even have credit cards back then.  If you happened to have cash on you when the storm hit, that was the only cash available for quite a few days until businesses opened."

308,"I have a knot in my back from snow shoveling that winter.  I don’t think it’ll ever go away.

I remember one day waking up, shoveling out my car, driving to my mother’s house, shoveling her car and house out, going to work, shoveling my work place out, climbing onto the roof to shovel off the roof, driving to my mother’s house to shovel her parking spot and house (it was snowing again) then driving home to shovel out my parking spot. I spent basically 14 hours straight just shoveling.

Edit: I should add that despite all that, I still love the snow ??"
309,"I’ll say this a million times, but apart from the obvious cost of living issues in Boston, it actually should not be your employer’s business where you choose to live as long as you can complete your tasks and be there physically when/if required. My commute my choice.

Healthcare is already unfairly tied to work in many cases. Lose your job then what? We already know.

Create community where you want to, not where an employer dictates. You don’t have to live within Boston to care about it and participate. I can take the T, spend money, volunteer, see a game. But living across the river or the commuter rail doesn’t make me invested? FOH."
310,"At this point how many people in Boston are originally Bostonians?

Woodworking is probably a bit more useful to take a class in. There is a much larger set of skills and tools to use in learning woodworking. Many of those would also transfer to things like 3d printing because learning to properly measure things is actually a skill that you need to develop and practice."

314,"I remember reading that canada geese, for example, only fly south to find food (which is normally grass).  A combination of warmer weather and people feeding the geese means they can get food right here.  They don't mind the cold, apparently, they just mind being hungry.  They'll fly as far south as they need to get food.

  
So don't feed wild geese, that helps keep their migration patterns going.  Not much we can do in the short term about the climate getting warmer, though."

323,"One thing I haven’t seen mentioned is the fact that all of these labs funded with federal dollars are currently buying supplies and equipment from local and national companies. Even though these expenses fall under direct costs, it won’t matter, because as stated by others in this thread, orgs will have to drastically cut back the amount of federal grants they take because they’ll come at a net loss. So ultimately fewer grants, fewer labs, and less money being recirculated into the economy. 

All of those companies will also lose billions as their customers dry up. Those companies will then also have to lay people off. 

The people implementing these policies do not understand the ripple effects these kinds of things will have. This is going to be economically devastating."

They also don’t upcharge on the groceries like DoorDash, instant cart, etc. I usually do one delivery per week and only money I loose is the tip which is well worth the saved time and hassle. Lugging groceries on the public transit sounds like a nightmare."
325,"Because Boston's streets suck. They sucked well before bike lanes and bus lanes. Now it's a hodgepodge of rules slapped on top of an already stressed system. For me it's less ""why the fuck are you doing that""  and more ""why are you doing that but you won't fix... "". 

In reality the city can't handle the amount of cats that keep coming in and out of it but it also doesn't have a dependable enough Transit system for a lot of workers."
326,"The housing shortage is insanely complex and anyone promising to ""fix"" it is a liar or an idiot.  The mayor is not a dictator.  They can not wave a magic wand and create more housing.  They have to work through the planning commission, the city council, and the neighborhood advocacy groups.  I don't care who you are, you are not going to bend those groups to your will.

Vowing to bring [more transparency](https://www.bostonglobe.com/tag/massachusetts-legislature-state-secrets/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) to a legislative body often accused of resisting it, Massachusetts Senate leaders unveiled a wide-ranging package of changes Thursday that would require lawmakers to file public summaries of all their bills and mandate that any votes in, or testimony submitted to, a legislative committee be made public.

The proposals, which need approval in the Senate and, in many cases, the House as well, could reshape the Legislature’s decades-old calendar and how much visibility the public is allowed into legislative decision-making.

The Senate is expected to vote on its rules packages next week, according to Senate aides. It’s unclear when the House will take up its own proposals.

The changes follow a session in which lawmakers [passed](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/12/metro/long-awaited-legislative-compromise-economic-bill-paves-way-revs-soccer-stadium/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) a [slew of](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/30/metro/mass-legislature-health-care-steward-collapse-drug-costs/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) major [legislation](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/14/science/after-drawn-out-battle-sweeping-climate-bill-passes-mass-legislature/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), but in doing so, frequently blew past their own [legislative deadlines](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/31/metro/massachusetts-legislature-end-of-formal-sessions-housing/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) and did most negotiating behind closed doors.

“We strongly believe that these rule changes continue to enhance the \[Legislature’s\] transparency,” said state Senator Joan Lovely, a Salem Democrat who headed the committee that wrote the package. “We want the public to be engaged, involved and be able to have . . . information online and available to them.”

Any changes lawmakers adopt would amend the internal rules the Legislature creates for itself, not actual law. Each chamber proposes, and passes, rules that govern its operations, but traditionally, the House and Senate also pass what are known as joint rules that cover both chambers and, thus, require approval by both.

Senate leaders released a variety of plans Thursday: They’re seeking to make all Senate and joint committee votes and testimony available to the "

She paid a lot of money to immigration lawyers to prepare all the paperwork needed to get her green card and work permit. She is an immigrant.  She followed all of our laws, did things the right way, and became a citizen because she respects us and wanted to be one of us. 

The people ICE are after are _invaders,_  not immigrants. I have no interest in protecting invaders. They break our laws and strive to change our cities into the hellhole they left. They came here to take, not to contribute to our society. 

If ICE wants to line them against a wall and shoot them, I will hand out the blindfolds. That is what you do to invaders. If you want to hire them or protect them and obstruct justice and interfere with the enforcement of democratically enacted laws, then you belong behind bars and should stand trial for treason.

Giving out free stuff to junkies who sleep next to heating vents, tends to attract that sort of stuff.

349,"Well... concern for Logan aircraft may also be a factor.  However, most of the land east of Boston Common is filled-in land so any building of any serious height would require pilings to be driven in at varying levels adding to the cost.  If any developer is not aware of this, or choose to ignore it, could create a building subject to toppling.  What high-rise buildings are downtown now is the limit.  Also, don't confuse downtown with land that was the original isthmus that connected Roxbury to downtown, which was an island for the most part.  There you have some bedrock so higher buildings like the Pru and Hancock were possible.  The OLD Hancock is on floating piles.  When you get over toward Back Bay, new high-rise buildings may not be possible due to the ground water situation.  When high-rises started to go in, the ground water that was maintaining existing building pilings started to dry up and buildings started to get cracked foundations and some tilt.  We now have the Boston Ground water Trust that monitors the situation for water/moisture levels.  In fact they have water injection points now to keep buildings from caving in.  Boston is not a quick and easy place to build due to things like this."

Our last elections resulted in a prop override for more funding (woo!) and so many people remained enraged by it despite there being almost nothing to cut in our town budget. I'm not sure how we will meet funding needs going forward.

From the parent groups I'm on, the schools are ok but resource strapped, and no one is sure if it'll get worse. It's esp. bad for special needs students.

We are expecting this spring and plan to keep an eye on the schools. If they don't improve, we plan to move in seven years or consider private school, though the cost may be prohibitive. I love how diverse Medford is, but schooling is important to us. 

A friend has a kid in Somerville. In high school, they can learn a trade as part of their regular curriculum, which I think is fantastic.

We have been more careful about sealing the windows and keeping the thermostat low when nobody’s in the house, and that seems to have lowered the bill by about $100 when comparing Dec to Jan, but it’s still higher than in past years… hearing similar things from coworkers who live nearby. As others have already noted, it appears Eversource was allowed to increase their rates."
354,"The best way to protect them would have been to give them a solid way to become legal. It's a completely messed up situation where we are dependent on people coming in here to do work, but also we do not give these people any kind of legal way to stay and work here. 

To be clear, I do not disagree with you - these people need to be helped. I am just pointing out that this is not a streak, this is not anything momentary or new - this is how we have functioned for many years, where we were happy to treat certain type of people as subhumans - even people holding legal work visas (like o-1) are paying into all kind of social funds like pension, but are not eligible to receive any benefits from it. And we were even more happy to close our eyes on all the illegal people, as long as they stayed quiet.

So while working on protecting these people from ICE, let's also not forget to work on them getting rights and benefits equal to other human beings here. That is, if we truly want them. If not - it may be worth to stop this theater, let them leave and deal with consequences."

Liang intentionally stalked Boston residents, including Frances Hui (a Hong Konger democracy activist who was an Emerson student). Liang followed her at protests and sent information to the Chinese Consulate and the United Front Work Department of the CCP. As a result, Frances was doxxed, harassed, and received gun threats. Frances also now has had a 1 million Hong Kong dollar [bounty](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/12/14/breaking-hong-kong-national-security-police-issue-arrest-warrants-hk1-million-bounties-for-5-overseas-activists/) on her head, likely as a result of this surveillance activity--just for advocating for democracy in her home. Liang did the same to local Taiwanese activists, stalking them and exposing their identities/affiliation to the PRC.

It's well-known what dissidents of the Chinese regime face, even in exile. If they still have family members in China or Hong Kong, their family members will face police harassment under the guise of ""questioning."" Frances' mother in HK was [harassed](https://hongkongfp.com/2024/01/11/hong-kong-police-take-mother-of-wanted-us-based-activist-frances-hui-away-for-questioning-reports/), and the same happens to countless other Chinese and HKers living abroad. As a result, these dissidents sometimes cut off family members from their lives to protect them from harassment. The CCP also has a [network of police stations](https://safeguarddefenders.com/sites/default/files/pdf/110%20Overseas%20%28v5%29.pdf) across the world (disguised as businesses), [including one discovered in NYC](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/new-york-resident-pleads-guilty-operating-secret-police-station-chinese-government-lower), that are used to harass dissidents like Frances on-the-ground. These police stations have been used to harass dissidents and try to compel them to leave exile.

The outcome of the legal process in this case is disappointing, but the evidence presented in the case is clear that Liang heinously stalked and harassed dissidents to serve the CCP. An American spy in China certainly would not be afforded this legal process."

It doesn't really matter if the place is fair/reliable, you'll know that by the way the car is priced and by the condition. You can get a lemon at a good dealership and a gem at a bad dealership. You just need to know what you're looking at.

By Catherine Carlock

Amid furor among many downtown residents, Boston officials will delay a zoning proposal that would allow for 500-foot skyscrapers along Washington Street in Downtown Crossing.

The move is the latest twist in a years-long process to rezone the neighborhood at the core of downtown, and one that crystallizes the clashing political and practical realities of Mayor Michelle Wu’s promises to both honor community-led planning and build enough to tackle Boston’s massive housing shortage. And it’s taking place within the tight confines of a central business district that operates much differently today than it did when the PLAN: Downtown effort first launched six years ago.

In late 2023, the Boston Planning and Development Agency board [approved PLAN: Downtown](http://www.bostonplans.org/news-calendar/news-updates/2023/12/14/bpda-adopts-plan-downtown-planning-initiative) as a planning document guiding future development in Boston’s central business district. The plan encourages zoning updates where heights would “match the scale of planned for growth and Downtown’s historic character areas,” including limiting heights in historic areas while maximizing height in the Financial District.

But PLAN: Downtown was not accompanied by specific changes to the zoning code, which sets out the fine-grained rules over what can be built where.

Those specifics arrived last month as the Planning Department unveiled a new zoning subdistrict that aims to create a more mixed-use downtown with plentiful housing, rather than one primarily centered around businesses. Called SKY-R, the subdistrict stretches down Washington Street from School Street and then wraps around the south side of Boston Common and the Public Garden to Arlington Street. It would allow for 500-foot towers along a stretch of that zone, in the heart of Downtown Crossing, for primarily residential buildings. Non-residential buildings would be capped at 155 feet.

The city’s chief planner, Kairos Shen, said the plan aims to add much-needed housing downtown and reflects a business district that serves different needs than it did just a few years ago.

“It’s really about addressing how we grow the downtown and actually manage change in the downtown,” he said at a public meeting last month. “The urgency of addressing these changes was even further elevated with the pandemic.”

But at that contentious gathering, many members of the committee advising the city on PLAN: Downtown protested that the SKY-R district flew in the face of recommendations they had spent six years crafting."

396,"Here's a niche case, but right where I live a busy intersection was retrofitted with protected lanes that get super wide near the intersection, for the sole purpose of preventing cars from going around a car that's waiting to take a left. They don't make it any safer for cyclists to make a left. I know because I am a cyclist, and the old, existing lanes were easier to get out of to make that left. It's a bit hard to describe.

But I also take the bus, which goes on that route. And that one change of making it impossible for cars to go around other cars taking a left has like tripled the time it takes to go a few blocks, because so many people go left from both directions, and there's no dedicated green turn time.

Now, I understand cars passing like that is often quite dangerous, but for some reason in this intersection it really always seemed totally fine. And again ii even ay that as a cyclist. Never felt in danger there.

So again pretty niche case. But I'm not someone who says ""fuck all cars"" and again, this affects public transit too. So I think causing huge traffic problems for the sake of ""safer"" bike lanes that don't even feel materially more safe to me as a cyclist, and in some cases feel more dangerous (there's also less visibility by turning cars since you're further away), I think it was a shit decision."

One thing I will say, if you are doing financing is that the loans they offered us through their partners were decent, but we had a better offer from MIT credit union (my husband banks there), so they got Wells Fargo to beat that rate. Something to consider if you have access to a CU!

When I picked up the car it was pretty easy to get there on public transportation. I took the commuter rail down to Brockton (Middleborough/Lakeville line) and then took a short uber to Bourne's. There is also a bus you can take to Bourne's from there, but I can't speak to that experience.

Also know that there is a Lemon Law in place in MA, but how long it is covered for depends on the number of miles on the car. Try to buy something under 50k miles!

433,"This has nothing to do with Boomer Upper-management or justifying office leases. **Ending remote is 2025-speak for layoffs.**

Dell is treading water and needs to make cuts to preserve the bottom line. Employee wages are amongst their biggest expenses. 

Rather than having managers assess who goes, who stays  - it is cheaper and more effective to let employees chose for themselves.  It's also much better for morale to give them the choice. It also gives them time to search. Ending remote work is an invitation to quit - and many already began job-hunting upon reading the memo. 

Dell will not backfill a lot of the positions once they're return to office. That work will go to existing employees or outsourced.

If and when Dell finds themselves in a favorable growth position, they will open themselves up to remote workers. Remember that being open to remote work expands the hiring pool and makes a company more competitive. 

This is the cycle we've been seeing since post-pandemic, and it's the cycle we're going to see going forward. The era of 'traditional layoffs' may be a thing of the past. Companies will oscillate between remote/hybrid and in-office policies pending on their financial position."

Any opportunity to join/mount a legal challenge to what is happening at the federal government right now is already being discussed and considered.

You might find some agricultural work, but that’s sub optimal for a student, With shit salaries (~17chf), far away from centers (hard to access), and they usually look for people for a higher occupational timeframe. 

Even tutoring kids might be hard: knowledge of the Swiss maturité curriculum is often required, which I don’t imagine you’re familiar with. With some luck you can tutor kids from an international school, I’d go there and leave my credentials on a board, it’s worth a try.

458,"Given the taxes we already pay to Geneva Canton, **yes**. 

I'll be honest here: Zurich has similar if not a slightly superior  public transport system (this can apply to all welfare in Zurich). But taxes are significantly less. So I find it reasonable we should get **more**. 

And I find free public transport is an excellent way to ""get more"" as it helps anyone, and especially people that have less economic means. Not to mention it helps decongesting the city from cars.

Now, should we have NEW taxes to pay for this? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. For sure this is not the worse reason to have a new tax implemented. This said, personally I would prefer to see the canton focused on getting more efficient with the money they already have, rather than increasing taxes. Once again, if you look at Zurich, there is definitely a case for inefficiency in public spending in Geneva. What's the root, I have no clue - but that should be the priority."

You can find a place with roommates if you really work hard on Facebook and the other sites, but it will take a few weeks if full time work…

It’s further from nature then you would expect. If you can drive and have a car then it’s fine but transportation costs are insane. It’s almost the same to go to Paris as it is Zurich sometimes. As a big outdoorsy guy that has been the hardest part for me. This city if you have money would be pretty solid because basically all the things people complain about get solved in some form or another with money. The problem is most college students don’t have money. 

French is key. (More then Paris imo) 

Free/very cheap school for non EU internationals is clutch though so as much as I complain about everything else being expensive that is a key part to factor in. 

The classes are average I would say. Some are great some are shit. Generally a chill academic vibe. My undergrad was harder but it was an intense program. 

Tldr if you have other offers and can pay for them/ think they will be cheaper and you don’t really really want a UN internship ( multiple people have warned me that they can be shit and a bit abusive/no pay) then I would check out other places.

Public school is actually a great experience for children, especially if you’ll have a short stay.

Testing of sirens – Wednesday 5 February 2025

Alertswiss App

 

Madam, Sir,

 

The canton of Geneva authorities wish to remind you that the annual testing of sirens across Switzerland is taking place on Wednesday 5 February 2025 from 13:30 to 15:30.

 

In Geneva, 116 sirens (a regular loud sound lasting one minute) as well as a “water alert signal” (for those residing below the Verbois and Chancy-Pougny hydroelectric dams) will be tested. Alarms will also be tested in some buildings where instructions may be given to all those present.

 

It should also be noted that the national Alertswiss App is available for download by anyone. It sends out alerts, warnings, instructions and official information to all its users depending on their location.

 

The general public is not required to respond in any particular manner during this annual testing of sirens.

This is nonetheless an opportunity to remind all those concerned, how to react in case of a real alarm :

 

Listen to the radio;

Close doors and windows;

Inform your neighbours;

Do not use your phone (to avoid saturating the network);

If you are in a car please stop ventilation, close windows and turn on the radio;

If you are outdoors, please seek shelter in the nearest building, activity center, shop or office.

 

A flyer summarising good behaviour is attached to this email.

 

The Permanent Mission of Switzerland kindly asks you to forward this information to all your employees, including consular staff if applicable.

 

Best regards,

487,"Let say you'd come, do you have anywhere to stay during your studies? Don't think there's a campus with free rooms waiting for you. Some students who didn't plan it right ended up having to squat an old building illegally. And housing in general is a nightmare in that area."

489,"80k annuel, avec un appart adapté et sans aller au Arthur’s tous les week-ends ça sera largement suffisant surtout dans ta situation de plus avec un coloc.

Faut pas se monter la tête avec tout ce qu’on peut voir sur reddit. J’ai des potes qui vivent bien avec 5k par mois, faut juster gérer son budget (et pas avoir d’enfants ??)"
490,"Try to communicate by any means with the SAM, because (if I understand correctly and you don't have insurance since September) it's possible that they have already assigned an insurance ex officio to you. Normally they'll warn you first, but if you can't receive mail who knows if they have already done that.

I had a similar case, still pending resolution. I applied for an L permit last May, but I left in October and the permit hadn't still arrived, so I ignored that. I couldn't either announce my departure to the OCPM (special case since I was a European civil servant and I didn't have a normal permit), so I just left the country.

The following month I receive a letter in my old address (picked up by the new tenant) with an ultimatum from the SAM saying I need to get an insurance myself, or they'll assign one for me + administrative costs + late contract penalty. So I had to send an urgent mail (internationally because I was already gone) with the departure form to the OCPM in order for the SAM not to bill me anything. But I'm still pending to know if I need to pay retroactively all those months between May-October that I was supposed to have insurance.

So to summarize, if you don't have insurance since September and you can't get your mail, it's possible that the SAM has already hired insurance in your name and they would make you pay retroactively since then. I don't know about any possible subsidy though, someone else could answer that."

Edit: SuperSaver of SBB are only for train trip where there’s no changing train in the midst of the trip (for example it would work for Geneva-Renens but it wouldn’t work if you wanna use on Satigny-Renens because on this one there’s a train change)"

502,"Postmobile network is nowadays that of Orange SA Suisse i.e. Salt intrestingly Postmobile offers roughly the same package as Salt does just that Postmobile doesn’t charge any opening fees and furthermore there is no commitment period of half a year or a year. Salt itself does offer ”no opening fees” and a commitment time of only one month but usually they are promotional offers, I believe Europe XL is the name of the rate. The pricing at Salt is strange as the normal monthly rate is 59.95 but the de facto rate when bought during a promotional period is the same or more or less the same than that of which Postmobile sells. Previously, Postmobile used to sell Swisscom tariffs but they changed to Salt. In my own experience, living in the Vaud area in the alpine region the coverage is good but the customer service hasn’t always been the best. I guess it would depend of the promotional offers they have ongoing and I don’t know if the fact that I’m a foreigner although I speak french and german has anything to do with the less than stellar customer experience I’ve gotten of their customer service. Postmobile has their own customer service which might be a good thing."

522,from my experience as someone who knows people working at the UN. it's not really that they don't want to integrate rather is that there are here for too short of a time to truly integrate. they usually stay with each other as they know that they stay in Geneva for 5 years usually. their children are sent to private schools but they don't really have trouble fitting with the public school folks. one of my sons (age 15) is in the public but one of his friends is the son of a UN worker from Guyana. its very different from the Upper middle class Americans and British who usually stay with each other even thought they lived in Geneva for 15+ years. it all depends

- haven't tried Namura yet but heard good things.
- Shibata
- Izumi is fusion but quite good (the situation does make it better)
- Satchi is good if you take the omakase course but it's super expensive.

Middle range

- Amagaki in Plainpalais

- Yukiguni
- Nagomi ramen
- Susuru (not traditionnal but good)
- Umamido (same)


On the go and ""less"" expensive:

- Anzo at servette

532,"I don't think it's an obvious choice.  My wife and I went back and forth with the whole public/international school for our 6 year old at the time.   You didn't list your kids' age but I'll say at a young age (my kids are 8 and 3 now) we're quite happy with the public schools here in Geneva.  My son speaks fluent French, learning German and adjusted well (despite our initial anxiety).  He has friends in the neighborhood and we're happy with our choice. 

I'd say under 10 go for public and if it doesn't work out private.  Also if you are moving country to country private/international schools.  International schools also work in fluent English, and have quite an active social life with parents etc.  Many students are very well off kids with a lot of income and depending on your social status you might fit in well, or find that obnoxious.  (you should see some of their birthday parties! LOL).  

Even if  you're high up in an international org with discounted/free schooling I'd still pick public schools if you're staying here for a while.    

I'm not Swiss FWIW.  Most Swiss would absolutely pick public schools, though more for assimilation/elitism of your kids etc."

536,"Finding an apartment is indeed a challenge, even if you work with an agent (as I did thanks to the support of my organization). They were offering me apartments that were above my rent range that I set for myself and suggesting options that I didn't like (mind that I'm not super picky, but the 1-tiny-bedroom apartment in Paquis that was costing 2300 CHF was not my preferred option). I took a lot of time searching for the apartments directly on the web-sites of regies. Renting for a short time is difficult  they all want you for years to come, so it can happen that it's better to rent an airbnb for the first months, while you're looking for a proper apartment for long term rent.

Also, 110k CHF is a good salary for living comfortably. Consider the district where you rent - e.g. Paquis can be noisy at night because of the ""red lights"" district there (it's safe, but can be really noisy), but the apartments tend to be cheaper there."

542,"If the country you fly from is not France, you'll be on Swiss side. You can rent the car from Swiss or French side. Please note that you HAVE to rent a french car if you want (simple) access to the french sector from the swiss sector. 

Bus to Morzine start in swiss side, as they can't access french sector, they are at arrivals level. If it's a smaller shuttle such as a viano, they can be in french or swiss sector. 

As a UE resident, you should not need your passport since Switzerland is part if Schengen, your ID would suffice. I'd still take my passport though.

Édit : I'd suggest to rent a french car, in advance because you need the reservation paper to access french side. I think french is cheaper since you don't cross the border? Not sure though. They, you go to Lyon and back the next day, leave it in french side. Go downstairs from there (to the right of the customs, left to french security) and go through the luggages belts and cross the hallway. You Can get the bus to Morzine at this level or go upstairs if it's a smaller shuttle. When you come back to Geneva Airport, you'll already be on the swiss side, do the check in, go upstairs to security."

Look for places with a direct line of public transport to your workplace, this does not mean it has to be in the city center, you'd be surprised! Being outside of the city center gives you more chances to find something to rent.

Rent will go over your maximum, or you might get very lucky. Think 2300-2500.

Depends on where you live/work. There are plenty of public transport and Mobility.ch spots, but as soon as you want to go to France, you need wheels.

There are beautiful places anywhere along the coast in that area, that budget will definitely get you one, but for that money you should contact an agent and let them handle everything.

The canton of Geneva is the size of a London borough, so your assumption is wrong. The more in the center of Geneva you are the more local experiences you'll get. Your choice depends more on your lifestyle than on anything else, if you want a very quiet neighbourhood with houses then you'll have no option but to live in the outskirts.

561,"je pensais à des éléments plus importants comme les budgets.  

Coûts de mise en place : Les coûts de mise en place des programmes DEI peuvent être élevés, notamment si les cantons et les communes doivent créer de nouvelles structures et de nouveaux postes pour gérer ces programmes. Selon certaines estimations, les coûts de mise en place des programmes DEI peuvent aller de 1% à 5% du budget cantonal ou communal.

Coûts de formation et de développement : Les coûts de formation et de développement des employés pour les programmes DEI peuvent également être élevés. Selon certaines estimations, les coûts de formation et de développement peuvent aller de 0,5% à 2% du budget cantonal ou communal.

Coûts de recrutement et de rétention : Les coûts de recrutement et de rétention des employés pour les programmes DEI peuvent également être élevés. Selon certaines estimations, les coûts de recrutement et de rétention peuvent aller de 1% à 3% du budget cantonal ou communal.

Coûts de gestion et de suivi : Les coûts de gestion et de suivi des programmes DEI peuvent également être élevés. Selon certaines estimations, les coûts de gestion et de suivi peuvent aller de 0,5% à 2% du budget cantonal ou communal.

En termes de chiffres, voici quelques exemples de coûts potentiels pour la Suisse et Genève :

En Suisse, les coûts de mise en place des programmes DEI pour les entreprises peuvent aller de 500 millions à 2 milliards de francs par an.

Au canton de Genève, les coûts de mise en place des programmes DEI pour les entreprises peuvent aller de 50 millions à 200 millions de francs par an.

Dans la ville de Genève, les coûts de mise en place des programmes DEI pour les entreprises peuvent aller de 10 millions à 50 millions de francs par an."
562,"Hopefully more roads will continue to close to traffic and/or add a congestion charge to push 1 passenger cars (i.e. just driver) to start taking public transportation.

Additionally trams like the one in Annemass next to be extended into France to encourage people to take them. For example, the 18 that stops at Cern was planned to got o Saint Genuis over 10 years ago.

565,"In Geneva, all the jams are artificially created. i've been to number of big size cities in europe, 2-3m no issue with jams. Yes, there are frequent but effort is made to keep the traffic flow, and it does flow. Keep the 'green' waves, rather then introduce 'red' waves like commies do in Geneva.

Congestions are made artificially here by pushing red lights with no other reason but to annoy, closing lanes and blocking perfectly sensible turns that were present for ages (another exteme is to allow insensible turns where they should not be allowed - again, in order to congest even more).

Take for an example Route de Ferney next to Intercontinental. Perfectly viable two lane road is reduced to one, the other one turned into a bus lane - for a single bus that goes every 15 min. Justification - new 'Grand Saconnex' tunnel opened. True, the new useless tunnel opened that costed hundreds of millions that will benefit few frontaliers living in Gex and working in WHO. Not even others working in other organizations - they don't use the tunnel.

To pass the stretch from Sismondi to the broken chair at 09am - takes 30 min (yes, 30 minutes for 500m) on the road 'designed to alleviate the traffic with the newly opened tunnel). The congestion that was never there before the Ferney lane was closed.

Funny there is never a congestion in the tunnel - since no one uses it anyway. Even in order to get to it you need to pass through small streets interrupted by unnecessary traffic lights. Millions vasted but Geneva tax payers seem to be happy about it - so be it. Same goes for useless Grand Saconnex junction - another project that took 10 years to develop for no reason at all (other than to keep labor busy and keep social peace).

But tunnel or the bridge to cross the lake - a big no."
566,"I stayed in Foyer a long time ago. Was a good, clean, safe place, albeit a bit utilitarian. People there ranged from students, interns, new arrivals searching for a flat (me), all the way to gals working at the United Nations, staying at the Foyer for years. Age range maybe 18 to early 40s in some cases, but average on the younger side. They used to serve breakfast back then, which was very,very handy. The nuns were very sweet and I found it conveniently located for getting to my workplace near Cornavin by tram.

I once picked up a colleague from Boniface and their room was okay, but on the way I had gotten lost or taken a wrong turn and ended up in the wrong part of the building, which maybe was the cheaper part? I got out of there as fast as I could, it was a bit scary."
567,"You need to estimate next year's income, and then submit that to the tax authorities. They will then calculate the acomptes which from next year are paid monthly from January to December included, it's basically a normal QR code invoice"
568,"You are absolutely right, and this is the result of years of laxist policies and capitulation of any sense of law and order. The only way to improve things is to vote the municipality's executive out. Thankfully there is an election later this year."
569,"Hi, please keep in mine that GVA is a small City, there is no « downtown » area as in London or NY, the single worst thing in Geneva is driving during peak ours. Everything is doable by foot and public transport, or by bike. As of safe areas, there are no areas in Geneva that are really dangerous. 
Living in the city is great and I think it’s easier to meet people being an expat."
570,"Option 3 (far more realistic): fly to Geneva and enjoy it.

Option 4 (if you want mountains): fly to Geneva, transit to Zermatt with the train, and spend 2 days there.

One thing for sure is that you shouldn't try to see everything. FOMO is a trap. Pick one place and enjoy it fully. And Paris is a bad idea because no matter when, you'll still spend 5 hours in a train."
571,"There are direct trains to Lausanne, Montreux and Annecy from Geneva main station (Cornavin). 

Montreux and also Vevey are very scenic and there's plenty to see and do, Lausanne you might want to go to Ouchy (Olympics museum and so on)."
572,"Les armures is also another great option. Their terrace is great, the staff are really nice and all speak English. Your would order the fondue per person, and they will prepare it for that number of people. as you may have seen in pictures, people share the same pot. Usually a pot can be for upto 4 people or so.

Usually the fondue comes with bread only, but you can order potatoes , cured meat and pickles on the side."
573,"Hi everyone!

My wife is an amazing Botanical Illustrator and teacher from Colombia, and she’s excited to start sharing her art here in Geneva through a workshop. She’s passionate about teaching and wants to introduce others to the beauty of botanical illustration.

I’d love to help her spread the word, as I know many in the community would be interested in this kind of creative activity.

You can find more details about her work and the workshop here: [https://tinyurl.com/botanical-workshop](https://tinyurl.com/botanical-workshop).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!"

575,"Having a car in Geneva is more trouble than it is worth. But it might be worthwhile if you can get parking on the edge of  town somewhere, especially if you'd like to explore neighbouring France on the weekends. 

In Geneva itself sometimes when I'm walking around I notice that I'm faster than traffic and I start to wonder why anybody would do that to themselves.

But in France outside of the cities you need a car."
576,"The Beau Rivage has a winter offering where they have ski télécabines on their terrasse with very nice fondue. That could be a romantic spot for a proposal, very unique but also discrete. Otherwise Beau Rivage also had an offering in the past for an in-suite dining experience, you could ask them about that. Finally, try to call the Four Seasons and book one of their small salons on the first floor for a completely private and very luxurious proposal. All the best for a wonderful day!"
577,"I think 95% of the use of the site is people knowing exactly what bus or tram to take, usually near their work or home, and just want to know when the next one will show up. The old app did this better, it basically mirrored the data you have at the screens at the bus stop.

Instead the app is designed for the remainder 5%, who want to enter a start and end point and get itineraries and alternatives and the like. Like more serious transport such as cff or airlines. TPG wanted to copy those heavy hitters and forgot what their customers were about. 

That’s my theory anyway."
578,"For having met a lot of them, they mostly aren't open minded at all and start from the principle that if you are not thinking exactly like them that i.e borders should be open everywhere because it's a privilege (the woman that told me that worked for the president of the Philippines, how ironic and hypocritical) that rich countries are privileged (they come to live in Switzerland and think like that lol) then you are a fascist and they will start ghosting you or being agressive through a last unrespectful text. (While they are living in MY country so I insist they should show respect and not act like social cases).

Before I've met them, I was totally fine with them, after meeting something like 50, (from UK, China, Philippines, USA, mostly) I don't want to have anything else to do with them anymore. And I was not saying anything crazy or engaging on political topics btw. For instance once I've said I didn't have any point of view regarding Trump or biden because I was asked out of nowhere, then I have been ghosted and after asking what was the matter latter received a very unrespectful message to say I was a fascist. Most of them aren't able to talk about politics since they will vex very quickly if you aren't sharing exactly the same ideas. The UK one was very uneducated as well, the kind of pushing you outside 5mns after sex just because she's stressing out because of work, then harassing for being in a real relationship, and really not inclined into using a condom until IST Test is made. (I had to insist heavily).

So yeah, UN workers are one kin not letting indigenous people live their life I would say, while they should be discreet and humble. I've noticed they were a little less inclined to cause an uproar while they have higher responsabilities. These I could get along with them like normal people.

PS: they don't adapt the place they come to live also, many UN workers can't speak french at all, don't even have the will to learn the basics, worst than that some think they will live as their former place, in Switzerland, I e tte Chinese women thinking the dating game here is like in China, like the guy has to pay everything for a woman that is already having several sex friends.

Crazy people."
579,"I think there is some way to retain the rent in a blocked bank account. Basically she would still pay the rent, but it would be in an intermediary account until the issues are fixed. I suggest she looks into that and finds more info."
580,"Recipe for cheese fondue and whether your house has a bunker in the basement.

But on a serious note here's what you expect - the interview isn't meant to be a trap - they mainly want to see that you understand Swiss life and are genuinely integrated. Local stuff like politics, regions (how they are different, etc.), and other basics

I prepared for my canton, Geneva and yes there were questions about it, like who's in the government or main industries and what sort of jobs most people do in a certain area. Read 20 Minuten regularly - gives you a good sense of what's happening.

I almost natively speak French so I gave mine in that and also I was told that they were expecting me to know this because my canton was Geneva. But I am not sure if it's a requirement. As long as you can maybe hold some conversation in either of the three languages you should be fine

Just be original don't make it too artificial. They are judging your character too and it would be better in my opinion if you come across as someone genuine. Why you want to be a Swiss citizen as others said is almost certainly there. Don't stress about being one hundred percent correct on dates, facts, etc. At the end of the day, you're just a human, not a book. Best wishes!"
581,"I managed to go from international arrival to domestic departure, gate to gate, within 30 minutes in late evening earlier this month. My flight was Shanghai to Zurich to Geneva, and the first flight was delayed. If you don't feel ""safe"", let the crew know. They are usually very friendly, and can help you to get off the plane first if you need to catch the next flight."
582,"Possible but if you value your time, then it is probably not worth it. 

I'd say do it only if you can't move closer. Otherwise, even if it is more expensive, your life will probably be more enjoyable."
583,"I don't think it matters to them if you've the permit or not because you will be doing your own taxes as a contract worker.  All they will do is pay your contract fee rates. 

What will matter is that as a freelancer, you need to declare your income and pay for the contribution on your own."
584,"I don't understand how a commercially important city like Geneva has been in the hands of socialist and green parties for so long. 

Unfortunately while the left was more concerned with central liberal idealism in the past, it's followed the trend of other contemporary left parties worldwide and gone extreme left. Hence the city has gone to shit. 

More homelessness and immigration, gypsies, bad road management, terrible public works management, and lower quality of service because everyone working here is now French. Oh, and government offices where people don't speak English and that are never open. 

The only way out of a slow decline into complete shit is voting out the green party and socialists. At least until they balance themselves back to center politics."
585,"There are loads of types of CDL. Step 1 is to figure out which you have and which you need to be able to work, and what will happen to it if you divorce.


Optional step 2 is then to apply for an L permit as an EU jobseeker, having bought Swiss health insurance (assuming you don't already, maybe you're currently covered by something else thanks to your wife) 


If you don't have a current work permit then I think the best option is just to say you are an EU citizen (hence with the right to work) but with no current work permit. That shouldn't be an issue since you apply for it yourself at no cost or difficulty to the employer once you have a contract.


Re job hunting itself, I don't know really. It's tough I think. Best of luck."
586,"Cheese:

Take the number 5 bus from the airport to the Intercontinental stop. Then walk to Café du Soleil in Petit Sacconex.

The best walking route is through the park and farm of Bude.

Shared route
From Rte de Ferney 106, 1209 Genève to Café du Soleil, Pl. du Petit-Saconnex 6, 1209 Genève via Chem. Moïse-Duboule.

9 min (600 m)

You go up the little stairs into the parking lot of the COOP mini-mall, then go directly through the mall. From there go straight along the north edge of the park, past the manor house and the farm. 

Check with the restaurant that they have tables for lunch.

587,"The only thing I can think of when I hear the term ""vegetarian fondue"" is a pot of minced spinach in a broth. 

Swiss fondue is by definition a cheese fondue, thus made with rennet. It's also caloric. If you're concerned about even cheese when it comes to animal welfare, Swiss fondue is not something you should aim to eat."
588,"One of the problems is the need to keep the street partially open. It obviously makes work longer in many cases.

589,"Cost of living comparison with London depends on your lifestyle in London and where you live around Geneva.

Geneva has a very good German school (private). It reads like you are looking for reasons not to move to present those to your husband maybe? Try and come for a look and see for a long weekend. It will give you an idea. Life, especially as a young family is hard to imagine in London for me. It was fun as a single 25 years ago. 

It doesn’t seem so now. You’ll have real work life balance here with nature at your doorstep, lakes, mountains etc. Depends what you value really."

I really think you’re overthinking this and finding a slight where there wasn’t one. And I’m not sure how letting you take the elevator makes you feel unsafe."

597,"The problem is that transfer companies have to pay a lot to legally operate in Switzerland, so even if they come from France to pick you up, they risk big problems when they cross the border without a licence and it's impossible to pick you on the French side if you fly into Switzerland.So that's why the price which is actually not too bad for Geneva. Leman express to Cluses+bus/taxi is going to be a pain, but it is cheaper if your budget is really tight. Chamonix is much better connected,but I assume you've already chosen the ski resort.

Edit. You could in theory take an uber to the French sector and get a France-only transfer from there, I can't tell from the top of my head if it's worth the hassle money -wise though. That's something I would do if I needed to rent a car in France"
